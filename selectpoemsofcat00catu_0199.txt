NOTES. LXVI„ 31-46. 147

31. tantus. ‘What god had power to change you ‘P’ Cf.
Verg. Aen. 1. 605:

‘ Quae te tam laeta tulerunt
Saecula ? qui tanti talem oenuere parentes? ¹

an quod. ‘Was it not because . . . . ‘2'
33. atque. Cf. va. 23 note.

11³¹, ‘them'

me. The MSS. read pro.

37. coetu, dative. Cf. Lxrv. 386.

38. pristina vota novo, ‘ pay an old-world vow with a novel
sacrifice.' To make vows for the safe return of husbands was
an ancient custon1; to pay them in the form of the sacrifice
of a lock of hair was a new thing, at least in Egypt. Ellis
renders, ‘ pay the vows of the past with an offering of to-day '
—a frigid antithesis, but perhaps possible in an Alexandrino
poet.

dissoliio. Of. 11. 13, note.

41. quod = caput. ‘ By which head if any man have salsely
sworn, may he reap fit reward 1' Cf. 18.

42. qul z quis.
postulet = ‘ could claim.'

43. eversuS, ‘even that mountain was razed, which is the
greatest in the world over which Thia’s bright offspring rides.'

44. progenies Thiae = ἡλίος. Cf. Pind. Is, 1v. μᾶτερ ἀελίου
Θεία. Others read Phthiae (as nearer to the MSS„ Phitiae),
but proyenies would be obscure (standing, perhaps, for ‘ Mace-
donians’), and supervehitur would be used in the unusual
nautical sense of ‘weathering a point‚’ the proper word for
which is superare, as in Liv. XLII. 48 ; Verg. Ecl. V111. 6,
Aen. 1. 244.

45. peperere (MSS., propere), ‘created' Rossbach, pro-
pa erc.

46. barbara iuventus. ‘the Oriental chivalry.’

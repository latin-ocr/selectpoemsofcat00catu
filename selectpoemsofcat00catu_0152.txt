100 NOTES. XLIV.,1-11.

XLIV.

P. 17, 1. seu Sabine seu Tiburs, ‘whether your title be Sabine
or Tiburtine.’ Sabine is an instance of very rare attraction,
that of a predicative adjective to the voe. case, made perhaps
easier here by the omission of the substantive verb. Cf. Verg.
Aen. lx. 641, macte nova virtu-te mter,- Tib. ῑ. vii. 58, sic venias
hodierne ,· Aesch„ Supp. 535, γενοῦ πολυμνήστωρ ἔφαπτορ Ἰοῦς-ς
Theoc. XVII. 66, ὄλβιε κῶρε γένοιο. Such passages as Verg.
Aen. 11. 282, ‘Quibus Hector ab oris Expectate venis?' (and
add x. 811, ΧΠ. 947, Pers. 111. 29) are not parallel, as the
vocative does not contain the main predication.

Tibur, twenty miles from Rome, was a fashionable locality
at this time, much more esteemed than the neighbouring
Sabine district, and praised by Horace, Od. 1. vii. 13, 1. xviii.
2, 11. vi. 5, 1v. iii. 10. There the great, such as Maecenas,
Sallust, Quintilius Varus, had their villas ; and Catullus eon·
sesses his desire for the vanity of a fashionable address.

2. ‘ Tiburtine they swear you, who have no beart to hurt
my feelings, but those who have the heart protest under any
forfeit that you are Sabine)

3. cordi, a locative, ¹ at beart)

7. ‘And cleared my ehest of a villainous cough, which—
serve me right—my belly made me catch. while I was hanker-
ing after profuse dinners.’

expufl is nearer the MSS. expulsus sum than expui.

9. dedit comes before its time, as yemmzc in LXVl. 18, ‘non
ita me clivi, vera ymnum, jum-inc) Cf. valn. Β. 28, 108.
’ἓξὲξ isl 1saiSdssto be an Alexandrine trick, but see Munro on

10. Sestianus . . . . conviva, ‘to dine with Sestius.’ Cicero
speaks of the absurdities of ‘dicta Sestiana, ' (ad D. vn. 32),
and uses his name as a term of literary condemnation (ad Att.
VII. 17, ‘ m'lzil uuquam Zeyi scriptum σηστιωὅέσ-ι·εροι1 ’),

11. petitorem, ‘prc secutor’ in a suit, or ‘candidate' at an
eleetion.

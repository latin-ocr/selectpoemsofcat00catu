APPENDIX Ι.
THE VERSIFICATIoN on CATULLUS.

A. More than a. third of Camlllus' poenls :tr-2. written in the
HENDECASYLLABm metre. This meere is ascribed to the ιιι
vent-,ion and known by the name of PnALAEcus, and one
epigram of his is extant in the Anthology. lt was used by
Sappho, Anacreon, and (mixed with other metros) by Calli-
machus and Theocritus. It is the mctre of part of tho
Asshenian drinking-song z

ἐν μύρτου κλαδὶ τὸ ξίφος φορήσω.

l'there· are about 542 hendecasyllables in Catullus, and thr·
sc eme 18:

‹a› ---------- ⁹
(β) ---------- ν
(γ) νννννννννν ἵ

The pocms writssen in this mefire are 1.-111.‚ V.-V11.‚ IX„ X.,
X11.·XV1.‚ XX1.‚ XXIV„ xxvn„ XXV111.‚ XXX11.‚ XXX111..
XXXV„ xxxw„ XXXVIII„ XL. -XL111., XLIV.-L., L111.-LV111.

(a) is by far fahe commonesb form, and is rigidly followed by
the only other great master of hendecasyllables, M arbial.

(β) occurs about 33 times: 1., v1. (ἲ), XX1.‚ xxxn. (bis),
XXXV. (bis), XXXVI. (bis), XXXVII. (bis), XL.⁵ XLI. (bis), XL11.
(septies), XLV. (quater), XLvn, XLIX. (bis), L„ LIV„ Lvn.

(γ) occure 34 times: 1., 11., 111., X11.‚ XXVI. (bis), XXXII.
(quater), XXXV. (ter), XXXV1. (ter), XXXV111. (bis), XL. (ter),
xLx. (bis), XL11. (ter), XLV. (ter), XLIX. (bis), L111., L1v., Lv.

In LV. after fihe base (or first foot) a spondee is found, in
place of the usual dacfiyl, in 15 vv.

One verse (XL. 1) is perhaps hypermetrical: but v. nobe.

The two cases of hiatus, XXXV111. 2, LVII. 7, are probably
due to corruption of the text: see notes.

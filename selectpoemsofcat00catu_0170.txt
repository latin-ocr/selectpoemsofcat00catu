118 NOTES. LX11.‚9-32.

9. non temere. ‘And yet not thoughtlessly: they will
sing what we must in duty regard.'

visere. So the best MSS. An obvious emendation is
vincere, ‘ what it is our task to surpass.’

ll. ‘ We have uo easy palm, brothers, already won.'
aequales i.e., actaea, ἥλικες.

12. seeum requirunt, ‘ silently recall their studiecl lays.
They do not study in vain : they bring with them something
fit to live. How should they not, for they labour in the deep
mines of thought Τ

another.' Cf. Verg. Aen. VIII. 20 ε

⁴ animum nunc huc celerem nunc dividit illuc.⁷

Phoen,: τὸ νικᾶν ἐστὶ πᾶν εὐβουλία.

17. saitem, ‘ ssing your courage, at least, into the contest.’

29. nec, ‘and yet not.’ Cf. xxx. 4 note.

32. The sequence of thought may have been: ‘Hesperus
is a robber, for he brings night, when watohers wake and
robbers Iurk.' To which the answer is returned (37) ι ² True,
robbers lurk by night3 but Hesper returns as Phosphor‚ and
arrests them? Thus 32-35 would have run something like
the following:

‘ Hesperus e nobis, aquales, abstulit unam .·
Ecqua tuum virqo non oderit, Hespere, nomen?
Namque cuo adventu rlgyilat custodia semper .·
Nocte lacentfures: tu noctem-furibus α ἰη’

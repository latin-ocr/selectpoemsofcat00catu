citata. Attis is henceforward spoken of indifferently as of
ei‘bher sex. Translate, ‘the restless feminine shape.'

typanum is another form of tympanum, ‘ tambourine.

9. tubam. As the ’erumpet is an instrument employed, nob
in Greek, but in Roman ritual, Ellis would render this word
(very harshly) as in opposition to typammz, and somehow
equivalenb to ἀντὶ σάλπιγγος, the tambourine which is in the
rites of Cybele whab the trumpet is in 'che rites of other gods,
‘ the tambourine that is trumpet to Cybele.'

Munro reads ‘ac typum,' signifying a medallion of Cybele
worn by her worshippers. A simple, but rather weak‚ altera-
bion is to cuum Cybelle. The name has various forms, Κυβήλη,
Κύβελλα, Κυβέλη, Κυβήβη,

mater. Cf. mayna macer, Idaea mater, mater deorum.

untia, ‘rituaL' ‘mystic instrument.’

12. Gallae. The emasculated priests of the Phrygian
goddess were generally called Galli. Cf. Verg. Aen. 1x. 617 ε

‘ O vere Phrysliae, nec enim ΡῘινῃῃεε, ite per alta
Dindyma, ubi assuetis biforem dat tibia cantum.
Tympana vos humusque vocat Berecyntia matri-s
Idaeae: sinite arma viris.'

13. vaga pecora, ‘ wandering sheep.'

15. sectam, ‘path’ Cf. Cic. Nat. Deor. 11. 22, ‘omnis
natura habel quasi viam quandam et sectam quam sequatur)
Ellis renders ‘following my rule‚’ certainly adopting the
colnmoner meaning of the word.

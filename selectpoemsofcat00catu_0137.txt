NOTES. XIV„ 17-22. XVII„ 1, 2. 85

17. sl luxerit, ‘ with the first streak of dawn.' Si with 2nd
Fut. = simul atque. Cf. Verg. Aen V. 64:

‘Praeterea si nona diem mortalibus almum
Aurora extulerit radiisque retexerit orbem‚'

md Cic. Phil. XIV. ii. 6, ‘Ad litera-s veniamei pauca ante, quae
ad ipsas litteras pertineam, diaeero.' The original meaning of
si in this usage was probably ‘as surely'as‚' ‘if it be allowed
that’3 but in Cicero’s time this conditional sense had faded
into a merely temporal force.

librariorum scrinia, ‘ the copyists' (or publishers') book-cases. ’

18. Aquinus = probably the poetaster of Cicero, Tusc. v.
xxii„ ‘Adhuc neminem coynovi poetam (et mihi fuit cum
Aquinio amicitia) qui sibi ozon optimus videretur)

19. Suffenum. XXH. Munro says this is genitive plural, after
omnia venena; but these words are better taken as a summary,
‘ every literary drug.' A bad book was ‘ poison' to Catullus.
Cf. XLIV. 10 to end.

20. remunerabor, ‘ return your present in kind?
21. Cf. xxvn. 5, XXXVI. IS.

22. ‘ Away to the regions whence you brought your bad
feet! Malum pedem alludes to the faulty measure of the
poems, as well as their unwelcome appearance.

Three verses, the fragment of another poem (ef. 11. 11-13
note) here follow in the MSS:

‘Si qui forie mearum ineptiarum
Lectores eritis manusque vestras
Non horrebitis admovere nobis.’

XVII.

1. The metre is Priapean. See Appendix Ι. c. (i. ).
ludere, ‘ celebrate your games.’ We hear of annual celebra-

· tions at Rome on the pons Sublicius, from which figures of men,

made of rushes, were thrown down. Hence the appropriate-
ness of the boon which the poet begs of the municipality in 8‚9.

2. paratum habes. Cf. Lx. 5, contemptam haberes, the
beginning of the analytic perfect, used also by Cicero, but
always, as yet, specially emphatic.

sed, δια, ‘ but in dread of the erazy shanks of that miserable
structure, propped on its poor posts that have done other
service, lest it turn on its back and find a bed in the depths
of the swamp.'

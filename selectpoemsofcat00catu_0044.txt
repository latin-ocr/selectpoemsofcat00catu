xl QUAESTIO 11.

Imitations of Catullus in the VIRGILIAN CATA-
LECTA and iu MARTIAL are incessant, and are too
numerous to admit 01· require statement in this place.
Outlines of poenis, ideas, phrases, and words are bor-
rowed freely and constan‘oly from Catullus, whom the
aubhors seem wisely to regard as the first] Latin poet
who struck out the true line-s in which Latin poetry
might run with success.

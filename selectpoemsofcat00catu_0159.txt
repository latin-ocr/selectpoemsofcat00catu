NOTES. LI., 2-16. 107

Λῦ- a translation Catullus' poem has been much over-praised.
Even his simplicity seem elaborate beside the Greek: for
instance, 90>mina¹ teyzmtur lumina nocte is artificia-l compared
with ὀππάτεσσι δ’ οὐδὲν ὅρημα. The whole of 2, identl‘de‘m.
spectat, misero, souitu suopte are superfluous. There is an

9. torpet. Compare Hor. Od. IV. 1. 35:

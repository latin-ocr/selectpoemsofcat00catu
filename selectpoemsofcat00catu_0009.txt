THE present edition has been carefully levised, in
accordanoe with the opinion of high educational author-
ities, in order to render this volume of selections from
Catullus perfectly suitable for school reading.

At the same time, from the soholar’s point of view,
a thorough recension has been made of the texb, and
the Appendices have been verified and augmented.
The N obes also have been reviewed and improved, and
include observabimus furnished by ΜΓ. Mum-o, to
whose kind criticism I am much indebted.

I am also obliged to ΜΓ. Τ. Agar (late J unior
Student. of Christ Church) for valuable correcfiions.

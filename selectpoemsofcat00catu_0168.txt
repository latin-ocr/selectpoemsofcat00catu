This marriage-song has no special occasion. At least it
contains 110 names, and no ideas peculiarly Roman. It is pro-
bably modelled upon, if not translated from, some Alexandrine
Epithalamium, or perhaps a Sapphic original. The form is
-that of a dialogue between tzhe two parts of a double chorus.

Star; bhe latter sing the beauty οἱ virginity‚ the former the
praises of the married stasse. The victory lies, of course, wissh
the advocabes of marriage, who continue with a final persua-
sion of the bride to be reooneiled to her happier lot, and con-

clude the hymn.

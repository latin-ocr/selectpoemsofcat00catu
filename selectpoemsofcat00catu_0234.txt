THE DICTION OF CATULLUS.

One of the greatest chari-ns of Catullus lies in the simplicity
and naturalness of his language, which are in great contrast to
the later artificial Latin style. In this ‘inimitable spon-

in syntax. However difficule the metre in which he writes,
however subtle the thought he would convey, he is never
intricate and never obscure. His words seem to have fallen

he uses the tongue of the wits of the town, the lips of the lover
of real life. Even his Greek words were those heard in com-
mon conversation. In the tmest sense, he followed

established in the Augustali age, that it almost banished from the lauguage
of poetry those ‹limium-ivos which are a characteristic, not only of catuuus'
diction, but of the letters to Atticus and of the verse oi Plautus <32 Terencet

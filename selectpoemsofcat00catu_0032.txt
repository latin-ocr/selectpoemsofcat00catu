of style. How much he depended on them for guid-
ance (far greater poet as he was than they) is curiously
illustrated by the lines (CXVI. 1-2> prefixed to these
remarks. There, wishing to find a means of winning
over Gellius and appeasing his hostility, he does not
send him a poem written from his own heart and
appealing to the heart of his enemy, but tries tofind
poems of Callimachus (for translation or imitation)
that will serve the same end. In LXV„ also, he seems
to imply that he does not care to compose without his
books.

But Catullus is no mere disciple of Alexandria. He
is a student also of the grand classica] writers of
Greece, and rises nearer to their elevation than any
Alexandrine had done. Still further, throughout all
his employment of acquired culture, he is a great

my obligations to him. Most of the views expressed in this
volume were formed before the appearance of his valuable
commentary: where Ι have borrowed from him Ι have

tion, where I have differed from him Ι have done so with
diffidence. In the following tables Ι have obtained a certain
number of parallelismS, which l had not before known, from

his notes.

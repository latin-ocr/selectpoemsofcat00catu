LXIV.

In this Epyllion Catullus has made extensive use of his
wide knowledge of Greek literature: on the subject of his
debts to the Greek poets, see Quaestio I. He has also been
largely imitated by later Latin writers: see Quaestio II. For
an account of the Catullian Hexameter, see Appendix I. G.

This poem has bcen much criticised for the ‘inordinate dis-
proportion of its parts,’ and ‘want of artistic finish at the
junctures.’ These are discoveries of the numbcred tape and
critical nail which cannot be grudged to the discoverers. They
are made, however, by the same scholare who maintain, alii
alio modo, the rigid mathematical symmetry of Catullus' other
poems. These scholars will therefore be ready to admit that
Catullus could not have committed these faults unconsciously'.
He must have intended the alleged ‘disproportion of the parts)
he must have meant to be careless of ‘artistic finish at the
junctures.' In fairness, then, we should examine his purpose
before condemning the means he took to work it out, and if
the purpose be poetically good, then judge the means by their
effect3 for there may, perhaps, be a higher unity than is
attained by the observance of the unities, and its parts may
be organically connected, requiring no ‘ callida junctura.’

The simple argument of the poem has been told in the Genera!
Introduction Ι. p. ix. The purpose of the poem is equally
simple. It is to give a picture of the ‘goldon prime of the ages,’
when man walked with godS. Man was frail indeed, even then;
but suffering followed close as the medicine of sin, and
wronged innocencc was exalted. An earthly hero was wel-
come to the gods, who honoured him with affinity to them-
selves, with gifts, and with their presence at his table. For
men were then of pure, good birth; and from the union of
god and man sprang the brightest pattcrns of chivalry.

The general sentiment is similar to that of the Fourth
Eclogue of Virgil. In one particular, the blessedness of family

urity·—a feelin much stronger and more predominant in
{tome at the fal of the Republic than we can well under-
stand now—appears iu Catullus' addi-css to the heroes (22-24)

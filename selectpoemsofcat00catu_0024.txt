xx GENERAL INTRODUGTION.

the lost arts ; and perhaps can only enjoy true vitality
in a synthetic language. Even among the ancients
but few grand masters of this art arose, separated by
wide iutervals of time and place. The last truly gifted
artist in opprobrium, if we may believe a profound
critic,¹ was Catullus. Some of his most vigorous pro-
ductione affect our altered taste with no pleasure or
admiration. Aurelius, the ‘ father of Inanition‚'
Mamurra, whose gluttony would have swallowed the
British Isles at a meal, Furius, too miserly to board
a flea or a spider, are pilloried with indignities peculiar
to the older world.2 But we can sympathize with an
indignation that stigmatizes the practical joke, when
wit is conspicuous by its absence. The fop, too, who,
because nature had decorated him with a white set of
teeth, grinned on every occasion down to a funeral,
received an appropriate castigation. The absolute
stupidity of the Veronese boor, incapable of appre-
ciating the treasure he possessed in his beautiful
young wife, would have justly provoked his towns-
men to pitch him headlong from the bridge into the
bluest of the mire. The terrible atrocities committed
on a helpless language by the mutilation of aspirates
is still unrepressed‚ and everybody knows the modern
replica of ‘Arrius’ But the most awful seals of
Catullus' wrath are opened against the bad poets, with
whom all times abound. The direst curses are invoked

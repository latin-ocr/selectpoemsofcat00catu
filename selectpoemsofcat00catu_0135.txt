Hibere. MSS. ahl. of Hiber ss'lssnp, the river Ebro. See
Ellis' note on text. The common, but perhaps unneccssary,

Mart. IV. 55. 8, x. 65. 3.

Ceston de Veneris sinu calentem?

10. seu quid, ‘or a something, if there be such, still more
fragrant and exquisite) Cf. xxn. 13, Lxxxn:

‘ Quligzti, sifibi ‘egis ⁰.⁶}d⁰⁸ {lebera Catlallum

⁴ Gaius Licinius Macer Calvus was born 82 B.c., and, like
Catullus, in company with whom he is often mentioned by
Augustan writers as an epigrammatist and erotic poet, died
young. He was, according to Cicero and Quintilian, an orator
of great promise, his impeachment of Vatinius being especially
famous. His vehemence was so striking ‘ut in media ejus
actione sumeret Vatinius reus ec exclamaret “ royo vos, judices,
num, si iste disertus est, ideo me damnari oportet? '⁷ ’ (Seneca,
Controv. vn. 19). Compare L111. L. and XCVI. are addressed
to him, and perhaps LV.

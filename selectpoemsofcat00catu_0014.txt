mutual passion of Peleus and Thetis—the solemn be·
trothal and the marriage scene. First, all Thessaly
throngs to see the palace and to admire the marvellous
coverlet of the bed, on which was wrought in colours
the whole of the story of Ariadne—her winning and
desertion-her standing desolate on the shore of Dia,
where she utters words of despair and reproach against
Theseus—the fulfilment of her curse at Athens—the
advent of Bacchus and his train, and her assumption
into heaven. Then. the tide of humanity passes, and
the gods enter: Chiron with garlands of every flower
that blows, Peneus with laurel branches, Prometheus
still wearing faint scars of his ancient doom-—followed
by Jove and all the great gods, except Phoebus and
his sister. The vener-able Fates spin their threads
and sing a prophetie song of the great Pelides, while
the divine guests sit round and banquet. Alas, that
human degeneracy had now banished the gods from
earthly soenes! The versification of the poem is as
little elaborate as the tale, but is everywhere felicitous.

continuity.

The ‘Attis' shows the orgiastic madness and wild
flight of some worshippers of Cybelo from their homes
in Greece to the sacred forests of Phrygia. The
rapidity and vehemence of the verse, corresponding
to the subject, make no pause until the end. No
English metre gives any such impression of intensity

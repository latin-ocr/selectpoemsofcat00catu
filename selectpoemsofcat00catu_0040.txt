xxxvi QUAESTIO II.

“could not have been published in the author's life-
time'’ (Munro). Yet Munro affirms that Catullus
imitated Lucretius. Before this view can be accepted
we must believe that in the course of a few months,
and during the illness which proved fatal to Catullus
(unless he died a violent death, for which there is no
evidence), he studied Lucretius' great philosophical
work throughout—for the parallelisms are found in
every book of that work—and then wrote his longest
and most elaborated poem¹‚ the ‘ Peleus and Thetisss
if not also XXXIV. and (this would be incredible) LXI.
Munro admits that the philosopher Cicero himself
could not have read the “‘ De Natura ’' four months
after the death of Lucretius,⁷ if he had not ‘had
anything to do with preparing it for publication!
Catullus, too, shows no taste for philosophy, no liking
for the more archaic Roman poetry. Stil] further,
there is no reason to think that he wrote his idyll last
of all his writings3 it was quite as probably one of his
earliest creations, Munro himself admits that ⁴ many
of Catullus' occasional poems on the other hand had
in all likelihood been seen by Lucretius’ Most pro—
bably, then, Catullus never read Lucretius, who, it
must also be remarked‚ if he imitated Catullus at all,
would be most likely to confine himself chiefly to the
hexameter poem. The parallelisms are given below—-

¹ Or, at least, the ⁴ Ariadne’ episode, which could not have
been at all suggested by Lucretius, and (see LXlV. introduc-
tion) is not as much out of place as is generally supposed.

Library, Oxford (generally known as Ο). Although
these are our best authorities, yet both conta‘m variae

edition was published 1472 A.D.—but all are obscured
by corrections, interpolated, and full of errors. There
are many, still less valuable, of later date.

corrections were made by the early Italian scholam,
and much too has been done by scholars of the present
century, whose attentions have at least atoned for the

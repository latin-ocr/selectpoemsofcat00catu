144 NOTES. LXV. LXVI.

Conington there gives atque its usual connecting force, saying
that here also it ‘couples ayz‘cur with excutitur, 01· perhaps
with procurrit) But a particle that hesitates is lost3 and I
am glad to receive the sanction of Ellis in taking atque as in-
troducing ‘in the form of an emphatic concluding clause a

P. 49. This poem, generally calleci ‘Coma Berenices‚’isa version
of the lost Βερενίκης πλόκαμος of Callimachus, and may have
been one of the translations sent by Catullus to Ortalus, in
lieu of original verses (LXV. 16.)

Os: Callimachus, Ovid in his critical catalogue of poets

(Am. 1. xv) says ε

‘Battiades semper toto cantabitur orbe .·
Quamvis inyenio ηοη valet, arte valet)

This oriticism is well borne out by the present translation.
The poem contains little imagination οἱ the higher kind, but
considerable artistic fancy. It is written in the mock-heroic
mood of Pope’s ‘Rape of the Lock‚’ and its commencement
reminds us curiously of Keats’ verses to the ‘Mermaid's
Tavern‚' the resort of Shakspere and Jonson, where, in a

Said he saw you in your glory
Underneath a new-old sign
Sipping beverage divine,
And pledging with contented smack
The Mermaid in the Zodiac.'

The same light ironical tone is visible in, and gives almost its
only charm to, the present poem. The conception itself is
moek-heroic. In detail, the great astronomer is introduced as
knowing about all the luminaries of the firmament, the risings
and obscurations of the stars, eclipses of the sun, and (mark
the anti-climax) the love-affairs of the moon. The king goes
out to mighty wars, a scarred veteran—of last night's love
encounter. Note next the scepticism as to the genuineness of
a bride’s tears, and the playful badinaqe about the cause of

NOTES. LXVIII 3., 8-19. 155

. S. ‘ May Allius, even after death, grow greater and greater
ln renown.'

P, 54, 9. sublimis. ‘Nor the high-flying spider weave his
gossamer web, and ply his trade on Allius' uncared-for name.’
Sublmzc‘s, cf. Hes. Εργ. 755, ἀερσιπότητος ἀράχνης.

11. Amathusia. Amathus, on the south coast of Cyprus,
had a celebrated temple of Aphrodite, who is named from her
city, as in Erycina, Paphia (so Patareus, Ἀθηναίη),

duplex, ⁸wily,’ like duplicis Ulyaeei, Hor. Od. 1. vi.
12. corruerit, ‘and how fiercely she convulsed me.’ Cf.

Lucr. V. 368:

⁸ Com-uere hanc rerum violento turbine summam)

Possibly the word might mean ‘fell upon me! Cf. Hor. od.

1. xix. 9: ‘In me tota ruem Venus.' Munro alters to ιον-
ruerit.

13. Trinacria rupes = Aetna.
14. lymphaque, ‘ ον the water! Cf. vn. 2 note.
15. tabescere, ‘melty Cf. inv. 243.

17. Qualis. If this simile apply to the tears (which from
laic 23 it would seem to do), then the latter partis an Homeric
extension of the picture beyond the occasion (cf. Il. lx. 14:

ἵστατο δακρυχέων ὥστε κρήνη μελάνυδρος
ἥ τε κ.τ,λ.) ;

for the ⁴ relies of tears ' can hardly be meant.

If the simile refer, like that of 23-5, to the welcome assist-
ance given by Allius (and this seems to give a better
sense), the hic 23 is rather hard. We should have expected
1ςκι or ac.

perlucens, ‘gleamingj’ as a mountain stream, seen from a
distance, appears like a bright line ; or⁷ in the common sense
of the word, ‘transparent.²

19 valle, ‘ rolled headlong down the sloping gome?

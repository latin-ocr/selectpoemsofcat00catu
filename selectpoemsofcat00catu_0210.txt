158 NOTES. LXVIII 8., 'zo-84.

tide engulf you, and bear you down into its sheer abyss—suoh
an abyss as, in the Greek story, near the city of Pheneus, at
the foot of Cyllene, drained the marsh and dried the rich
soil ; that abyss‚ to have dug which, breaking through thc
marrow of the mountain, is the glory of the falsely-styled

son of Amphitryon.’ Heracles was son of Jove and Alcmena²
the wife of Amphitryon.

P. 56. 70. siccare is Schrader’s certain correction of MSS.
siccari, which makes nonsense. The ‘ oozy soil ’ does not come

into the comparison, the only point of Which is the vastness of
the barathrum.

audit = ἀκούει = ‘has the 1·epute‚' as male audire == ‘ to
have a bad reputation,' but the construction with the infini-

tifve isssa remarkable Grecism. So falsiparens is an imitation
o ψευ οπατωρ.

73. monstra, ‘when with his unerring arrow he struck
down the monstrous Stymphalian birds, at the tyrannica]
bidding of an unworthy taskmaster‚' i.e., Eurystheus.

74. deterioris eri. Cf. Odyss. XI. 621, πολὺ χείρονι φωτὶ
Δεδμήμην, ὁ ὃέ μοι χαλεποὺς ἐπετέλλετ’ ἀέθλους.
78. tuum, MSS. Heyse emends
Qui tamen indomitam ferre jusyum domuit,
‘which taught you, though indomitable, to bear the yoke.’
Tamen then intensifies indomitam (see Munro’s note on Lucr.

111. 553). Enis’ dominum domitum misses the point, which is
the depth and strength of Laoclamz'a’s love.

79. ‘ Not sc dear to a life-weary father is the head of a late-
born grandson, his only daughtcr's nursiing, who has come at
last, after long delay, to inherit his grandsire's wealth, and
has given a name to be entered in the witnessed tablets ; who
banishes the unnatural joys of the mockcd next-of-kin‚ and
scares the bird of prey from the hoary head.'

83. derisi. Of. Hor. Sat. 11. v. 55: ἵ
‘ Captatorque dabit risus Nasica coronae.'¹

84. volturium was the nickname given to legacy-hunters,
{ahiel ufgg'· like vultures, by the side of the dying. Cf. Plaut.

‘ Turpilucricupidum ιε vocant cives tui ,-
Tum autem sunt aliz· qui te volturium vocant.

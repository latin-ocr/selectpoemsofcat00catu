APPENDIX 1. 177

verse consists of a dissyllabic base (a spondee, except in v. 9,
where it is a trochee), followed by three choriambs, and endec]

by two short syllables. The scheme is

F. The ‘Attis’ (LXIII.) is written in a metre which seems
to have been peculiar to poems of which the subject was the
worship of Cybele. This metre, with less than his usual
success in his imitations of classical metrcs (unfortunately so
brief), has been employed by the Poet Laureate in ‘ Boadicea.'
But the failure is more than pardonable, for the origin aud
development of the verse are still wrapped in obscurity. We
are told by Hephaestion—our great metrical authority—that
the system originally consists of an Ionic ‘J'em-amaeter Catalectic,
and that its name GALLIAMBIO has arisen from its special
employment. The simple scheme would then be

Ι
Ψ,,-.“-1..κ-κ--ῃψν-...ι-,ωκ

Such a verse, however, is not found in this poem. If,
however, we replace the Ionic α minore by an lonic α majore
in the first or third place, thus 2-

we can scau v. 18;1 and this suggests a clue. Granting that
two short syllables may be the metrical equivalent of one
long syllable, and vice versa, we obtain the following scheme,
which will scan every line 2-

α ἶ
5. v-ae —- -r —- ν — — Ηνν — §.a — v:
ὃ. ——- - ν -Ω ν - ·- Η - — V — ν z
7. vv νυν ,- v —— —— “vv vv ν - ν Σ

Thus the first half of vv. l, 2, 3, answers to a, scheme ὃς the
second half 1ο ἒ, scheme 3: V. 77 answers wholly to scheme
3: v. 22 to scheme 2: and so on. One difficulty remains.
This metre is said to be subject 1ο anaclasis. The exact force
of this word is still a subject of conjecture ; but in this usage

¹ But ΜΓ. Munro thinks both 18 and 54, the only verses in which the
ψ v -‘- — occurs in the first place, unmetrical.

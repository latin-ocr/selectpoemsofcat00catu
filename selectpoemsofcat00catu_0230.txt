it seems to refer to the phenomenon seen in scheme 5, 6, 7,
where a short syllable, apparently belonging to the second
Ionio, seems to have ‘bro-ken itself ba0k‚’ or ‘bent itself
back‚' so as to become inserted before the last long syllable of
the first Ionic; the same thing also occurring in the latter
half of the verse. But the simplet explanation of the fact
(as revealed by the present poem) is to refer this phenomenon
to a resolution of — into ν v, followed (though this is a
metrieal license requiring illustration) by a converse reunion
or consolidation of another ν v (the one v obtained by the
resolution, the other ν previously existing next to it in the
verse), into a new —. VVhatever be the theoretical explana-
tion, the above scheme will make the scansion of every verse
in this poem practieally clear.

G. Two poems (ΗΠΒ, LXIV.) contain 474 HEXAMETERS. In
both poenis, Catullus’ treatment of the hexameter differs from
that of Lueretius, as falling more largely under later Greek
influence. Both of these poets, who published their poems
very much about the same time, are inferior in versification to
Virgil, who, however, has occasionally imitated some of their
metrical peculial-ities. Both Lucretius and Catullus wrote

monotony, and also the wordiness‚ which this practice
caused, was avoided by Virgil, and an immeasurably greater
variety in effect was obtained by him, when (in the Georqics
and the Aeneid) he wrote passage by passage, not verse by
verse, distributing his periods among several lines with an
artistic arrangement of the pauses. The Ecloyues are naturally
nearer to the older treatment of the hexameter than the
longer poems. While we admit, as we must, the comparative
want of variety shown by an examination of the rhythm of
Catullus' hexameter, as judged by the standard of Lucretius
and still more of Virgil, we must, however, remember that
the latter poets wrote, the one more than seven thousand
verses, the other more than twelve thousand, Catullus not
five hundrc(l; and that monotony of rhythm in a poem of
sixty or even of four hundred lines, is a different thing from
such monotony in works ten or twenty times longer. It is
only by deliberate comparison that the rhythm of Catullus’
hexameter is found to be monotonous.

The following is a detailed account of the facts of the
hexameter in Catullus :—

156 NOTES. LXVIIIB„ 21-35.

21. lasso is probably to be taken with viatori, for lasso in
auclore involves a personification which belongs rather to the
style of later Latinity.

22. gravis, ‘ crushing heat‚’ Cf. ΙΙ. 8, ssavis ardor.

hiulcat, ‘makes to gape,' i.e., crack with dryness„ Cf.
Verg. Geor. 11. 363:

⁶ Hoc, ubi hiulca siti findit canis aestifer arva.'
23. hle, ‘ when Ι suffered thus.’

A nigro, (3513hurricane black with clouds. ’ ‘ Ater turbo‚' Verg.
en. x. .

25. Jam . . . . jam, ‘at one time . . . . at another time.'
Of. Verg. Aen. 1V. 175:

‘jamque Ιιοε cursu, jam praeterit illoa'

prece Pollucis, ‘ prayer to Pollux) Cf. Verg. Aen. 11. 31,

implorata (nominative), ⁴ won by prayer.’

27. ‘threw open a fenced field, and made a broad way
lilgpguffh it) (Munro, Journal of Philologus, No. 16, October

⁶29. Ad. quam = ‘ at whose house. The connection of
domum—dominam, and also the parallel words in the adieu
116 show that dominam is not Lesbia, who is never apparently
so called, but the lady of the house, whose assistance was all
important.

30. ‘Hither my lustrous goddess softly drew, and on the
polished threshold checked her glistening foot, rising on her
creaking sandal.' The creaking was a good omen.

32. innixa. Cf. ‘pictis innioea εοί]ιιινηῖ5,’ Ον. Am. 111. i. 31.

34. Protesilaeam, ‘of Protesilaus,' the first Greek to leap
ashore at Troy, and therefore (by an oracle) doomed. to im-
mediate death, which he met at the hands of a Trojan.

35. inceptam frustra, ‘ that house, bcgun never to be
finished.’ Homer, in speaking of Protesilaus (Il. 11. 601) has
ἐλέλειπτο καὶ δόμος ἡμιτελής, ‘the house had been left half
complete,’ i.e., as wanting its lord and master ; and this would
appear to have been rather misunderstood by Catullus.
Froehlich reads incepto (i.e., amore), ‘love begun but to be
baulkcd‚' which is almost as near to the MSS. inceplct.

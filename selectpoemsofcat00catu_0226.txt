174 APPENDIX Ι.

Β. nmmos.

(i.) There are in Catullus 55 TRIMETERS (1v., XXIX„ Ι,Ι[.), 111
which the pure iambic foot alone is used, with the exception
of LII. 2, 3, both of which verses begin with a spondee. The
tiibrach in XXIX. 23 (4th foot) is almost certainly a false
reading. In iv. ,ΧΧΙΧ. the coincidence of verba] and metrica]
accent is remmkable (except IV. 5, 6, 9, XXIX. 15, 21). For
C'aesura see (iii.) below.

(ii.) One poem (XXV.) is composed of Iambic TETRAMETERS
CATALECTIQ in which vv. 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, have a spondee
in the first place, and vv. 5, 13 a spondee 1n the fifth place,
or rather first place of the second half of the verse.

(iii.) In the SCAZON or OH0L1AM1310(=‘Limping Iambic’ )
metre of Hipponax, employed by Callimachus and Theocritus,
but little used by Latin poetsy befole Catullus, are written

occurs only 13 times ς 29 vv. have a spondee in the first place,
13 vv. have a spondee in the third place, and 74 a spondee in
both first and third pl.aces Atribrach ν ν ν, allowedb3 ⁷
Maitial in the thir dp or fourth place, is only found once (XXII.
19) in the second place; and once (LIX. 3) the third foot is a
dacty 1. In ΧΧΧνΙΙ. 5 the first foot' 1s a spondee (consumere),¹
not a ydactyl (confutuere). ‘ In Catullus' iambics and scazons,
which have the hepthemimcral caesura, the end of the second
foot must coincide with the end of a word.’ (Munro.) lv. 4,
XXIX. 22 are only apparent exceptions, for there the preposition
is separable from the verb.

Hunc φο juvenes, locum vz'llulamque palustrem
Tectam vimine junceo amicisque maniplis,

QUAESTIO I. xxix

of the Alexandrine poets‘l Not in their pedantry, for
he is without a trace of it 3 nor in their obscurity, for
heis rarely obscure, nor 111 their scrupulous choice
of the least obvious expression, for all he says is simple
and straightforward, . . . nor in their cosmopolitan
Hellenism which has ceased to think of individual
autonomy and cares only to influence the world, for he
can never forget that he is an Italian, a Veronese,
above all a Roman citizen ς nor in their flattery of the
great, for he is never happier than when he is scoffing
at worthless nobles or reviling Caesar : nor even in the
tone of their love poetry, for, with some unimportant
exceptions, he expresses not a Theocritean sentimen-
talism, which feeds on the thought of a beloved object,
and half contents itself with the shadow when the
reality is away 3 but rather a full feeling of the
enjoyment of life, the sensuous even coarse delights
of a love present and palpable‚ the melancholy which
attends the thought of death as ending them, and
the various episodes of a lover’s life, its quarrels,
reproaches, and reconciliation, or despair. So far as
these love-poems are Greek at all, they are like the
” early Greek lyrics, not the latest compositions of
Alexandria, and we are left to the conclusion that
Catullus is, except in the elegies‚ and to some extent
in the“ Peleus and Thetis‚” less indebted to Alexandrina
models than is generally supposed: amongst his per-
sonal friends Cinna, in the succeeding generation,
Virgil and Propertius, show far clearer proofs of
direct and conscious imitation)

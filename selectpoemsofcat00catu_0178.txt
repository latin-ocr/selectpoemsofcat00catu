126 NOTES. LXIV. 1-5.

and his closing lament (393 ad fin.); and the same feeling
also underlies the whole of Virgil's poem, breaking out more
clearly in the last lines, which end with a distinct echo¹ of
the ‘ Peleus and Thetis,'
‘ Oui non risere parentes
Nec deus hunc mensa dea nec diynata cubili est.’

Virgil hoped for the golden past to return. Catullus paints,
with the fondness of regret, two 01· three special soenes. Old-
world heroism, as without reproach, is portrayed in Peleus,
fit to consort with gods3 as without sear, in Theseus.
Theseus should indeed have been in sear ‘of his own soul’; but
the punishment of his sin is quick and heavy, More than this,
it is wrought through his filial love ε contrast the heroic affee-
tion of Theseus and Aegeus, with the modern relation of fathel
and son‘shown in vv. 401-2. Ancient justice, moreover, not only
held the sword5 to punish wrong; but with her other hand
gave rich compensation to the wronged. From the lonely
shore Ariadne is raised to the stars, and her sobs are changed
into the wild mirth and music of Iacchus ‘ and his jolly crew.'
So, in a wedding mood, we are naturally brought back to the
marriage-hall. There, when the Inortals retire, the scene
grows in grandeur and in solemnity‚ as the lesser gods and
then the great gods appear and take their places ; and as last
of all the most high Fates chant their annunciation of the
glorious issue ,of manhood and godhead united.

In this conception there is surely no gap or disproportion.
The subject is one ; all the parts are proper to its presentation,
and are arranged in a simplo and graceful order. It is not the
arrangement of the Virgilian epic, still less of an eightcenth-
century epopee. It is the natural, effective arrangement of
his subject, ehoscn by one of the world's great poets, who (lo
not write by rule, although they are the true legislators in
literature.

NOTES. LXVI„ 92-94. LXVIII A. 151

Ne Feceris, Non Feceris in idem incidat vitium, and no certain
example occurs, in classical writers, of this inaccuracy.
Scaliger altered non to ne. We might possibly avoid the
solecism and adhere to the MSS. by reading non vestri esc (for
est esse together, ef. LXXVI. 24) : ⁴ It becomes you not that 1,
your own hair, should lack offering,⁷ or (with Bentley)
‘unguent.' Of. LXVIII. Β. 111 scot-note. On the gender
ιιιιιῃι me see 63 note.

92. effice. ‘ Rather by your bounteous oblations give cause
for the stars to exelaim again and again, “ May I become a
Royal Tress ἱ then let Orion flash next to Aquarius! ’' '

Ellis alters to affice muneribus, which he admits to be ‘ an
expression of prose.' Then, like most editors, he has to begin
a new sentence at sidera, involving change of text, loss of
rhythm, and difficulties of tense sequence. IIe reads,

⁴ Sidera corruerent utinam, coma reqia flam,
Proximus Hydrochoi fulgeret Gay-senx

where fulqeret is from salabre: so Munro, who, however,
prefers ‘cerrum-inex and then sees no irregularity, rendering
⁴ though the stars shall all have to tumble down for it, I pray
Ι may become again a royal look. Orion, if he liked, might
then shine next to Aquarius.’ But none of the quotations to
illustrate fulyeret (imperf. subj.) seem parallel, as they all
refer the wish to a past time; or, rather, the force of the
tense is ‘ought to,’ ‘ought to have.’ It is much simplet to
take fulyeret as imperative present from [αἴρω-ατε.

94. ΗγᾱτοοὴοίεἽ δροχοεῖ. See Appendix 11. 4 ii. c. The
meaning of the verse is, that each star, could it have its desire
of becoming a royal lock gratificd, would be indifferent to the
confusion of the old abode, the heavens.

LXVIII A.

Much has been introduced into this poem by various com·
mentators which seems hardly contained iu the text 3 some of
it reflecting on the character of Manlius, some adding to the
blackness of Lesbia's character. If vv. 5, 6 ineant that Man-
lius has just lost his young wife Vinia, the bride of LXI„ then
it would be brutal of Manlius to ask for consolation in the
shape of the lighter sort of love-poems. If vv. 28, 29 meant

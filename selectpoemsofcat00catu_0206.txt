154 NOTES. LXVIIIA„ 37-40. LXVlII B.‚ 3-6.

capsula totus, of a man who looks as if he had just come ‘ out
os a bandbox.'

37. maligna, ‘niggardly.'
ingenuo, ‘ gentlemanly.
39. utriusque, i.e., both books and poema.

copia posta est, ‘lay before you a shore) Copiam ponere
seems ἅπαξ λεγόμενον, but not impossible. Munro reads
‘praesto est,’ the best of the emendations proposed.

40. ultro deferrem, ‘ 1 would have offered them unasked'

LXVIII 31.

This poem is connected in the MSS. with the preceding
epistle to Manlius. It is, however, addressed to Allius, who
must have been a different person, for no one bore two gentile
names. The form, too, is not epistolary, but that of a set, in-
deed rather complicated, composition. Observe the artifieial
arrangement by which the parts of the subject are repeated in
reverse order : Allius-Lesbia—Laodamia—Troy—fraterna
mors—Troy—Laodaniia-—Lesbia—Allius. So, but more na.-
turally, in the episode of LXIV„ the order of treatment is:
Ariadne »- Theseus —-A1·iadne—Theseus-—Ariadne. Though
this poem is guilty of ornate expansion‚ and though it is
wanting in Catullus' natural symmetry and direct simplicity

of expression, yet it contains lines which the world will not
willingly ‘let die‚⁷ such as 15-22, 30-32, 93-4, 119-20.

3. Ne, ‘lest Time, in his flight of unmindful generations,

oloak, in the blindness of night, this friendly act.' For ne
Ellis reads nec (with MSS. ), although he rejects the latter in
spite of similar evidence (or error) elsewhere. Of. 151.

The thought here and in 151 et seq. is the same as that
which constantly recurs in Shakspere's sonnets. Stone will
moulder, brass will rust 3 but verse will outlive both.

6. carta anus. Cf. ‘fama loquatur anus,' LXVII. 10.

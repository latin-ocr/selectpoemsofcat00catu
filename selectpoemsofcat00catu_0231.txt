APPENDIX Ι. 179

(e.g., ‘Nutrirum lemwst nxtv. 18), 5 times in mm„ 28 times
iu LXIV. Virgi1¹ only uses the ruder rhythm exeeptfflnally,
and in passages where he imitatus Catullus or Lucretius: in
the latter it is quite common.

2. In the third foot the caesura — v Ι υ (instead of
the more ordinary —- Ι ν ν ) occurs 7 times in Lxu.. ¹28
times in Lxlv. This is eonnnoner in Lueretius, and is frequent
iu Virgil, especially in the Eclognes.

3. Bucolic caesura. Tho fourth font closos with the end of
,ἰ word (generally a spondee) ‘27 timos in ιλιι, 247 tinum in
mclv. This is a favourite rhythtn (if not quite eo frequently
found) iu Lueretius ; but-although oecurring about 240 times
in the Eelo ues (which eontain 5:39 vv.)>-—it is generally
avoided by irgil in his other poems.

The trochaic rlaeyelaem iu a dactyl in the 4t11 foot (e. g„ saepe
levi somno suadebit Ι inire emm-ro) is lin-Greek, and ιε never
found in Catullus (once only in Cicero, according to Munro,
and rarely in the most finishcd parts of Lucretms). virgil
employa it (not reekoning the cases when the last short of
this dactyl is a monosgllable) 18 times in the Eclogues (329
vv.); 40 times in the eorgics (2188 vv.) ; and 135 times iu
the Aeneid (9895 vv.) 3 and it is perhaps still more frequentin
Ovid.

4. Catullus belonged to the σποιιδειάζοντες 2 6 times in LX11.,
aud 26 times in LXIV. only oue daetyl is found in a verse, in
the fourth or fifth foot, and twice (wa. 3, 44) the last five
feet are all spondeos. There are in wa. 27 dispondaic end-
ings, of which 8 are preceded by a dissyllable containing
two shorts (ν v ). Dispondaic endings are comparatively
rare in Lucretius, and a trispondaic ending is unknown. In
Virgil spondaic endin s are imitatione from the Greek or
perhaps Alexandrino a 'ectations. If the last word is a tetra·
syllable in Virgil it is also a proper name (so 10 times ; exc.
Eel. iv. 49, Aen. 111. 549) : not so in Catullus, who in wa.
has 22 dispondaio tetrasyllabic endings. When a dispondaie
ending is not also a tetrasyllable, it violates the usual law of
the Latin hexameter which requires metrieal ictus and verbal
aecent to correspond in the last two feet of the verse. This
irregularity occurs 5 times in LXIV„ and at least 13 times
in Virgil.

ιΙ find, however, that in the Eelogues this rhythm is far from exeep-

tional ; it is rarer in the Georgics‚ but still as frequent as in Catullus ; and
the same may be affirmed of the Aeneid-

78 NOTES. X., 9-26.

9-11. ‘ I answered, with simple -truth, that there was
nothing for natives, governors, or staff. thy, then, Ι asked,
should any one of us return with larded looks? ’'

I adopt without hesitation the reading of 11 proposed in
Munro’s ‘ Elucidations‚' where he ‹lemonstrates the regularity

14. quod . . . . esse, i.e., the ‘lectica octopltorus’ first

piece to be used in the colloquial sense of a modified positive,
no special contrast being meant; so also ‘quantum e-sc hominum

P, 6. 24. ut . . . . cinaediorem, ‘playing her impudent part
to perfeetion.’

26. commoda seems to be the imperative of commodare,
‘to lend.' But there is no other example of the shortening
of the final vowel in a polysyllabic imperative.

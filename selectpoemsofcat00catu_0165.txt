N OTES. LXI„ 57-93. 1 13

57. floridam ‘in her bloom.'

P. 24. 61. ‘ Passion ean find no fruit, fit to be sanetioned by good
report, without thy aid ; but is enabled by thy grace. What
god can be likened unto our god ‘2 '

65. compararier. For the archaia forms in Catullus set,
Appendix IL5 (i.).
68. stirpe vinc1er, ‘be outstripped by his children‚’ ele„ be

blest with a constantly improving posterity. This is not
a common Roman sentiment. Compare, however, Statius

Sat. 1v. 4 74:
‘ Sur'ye ayedum juvenemque puer deprende parentem’

quoted by Ellis, and the boast of Diomede z
ἡμεῖς τοι πατέρων μέγ’ ἀμείνονες εὐχόμεθ’ εἶναι.

Avantius read nitier, ‘rest 011 a new stock of children.' The
ordinary reading is junyier τ. ‘ be continued by posterity.'

71. ‘Did a land lack thy rites, she could not put forth
defenders for her bordas?

quae = si qua.

78. ‘Mark you how the torches toss their tresses of fire‘!''
Cf. 98. For coma (κομή), used of fire, compare cometa
(κομήτης), Add Aesch. Proin. l‚044, πυρὸς ἀμφήκης βόστρυ-
χος (from Ellis).

81. ‘True-born shame ’ (or ‘modesty ’) ‘ tax-ries long’ (or
⁸ hange back '); ‘and more attentive to its counsels, despite of
al] (tamem), than to any other (magsis), she weeps because she
needs must go.'

tardet. ἅπαξ λεγόμενον, if from tardere. Possibly, however,
the construction of the lost portion of the stanza required a
subjunctive here; in that case tardet would be active, ‘hold
her back‚' and comes from the common tardare.

⁴ P. 25, 91. Talis. ‘ In your likeness the hyacinth ever stands

forth pre-eminent in a rich master’s many-coloured garden of
flowers.' Observe that the poet compares, not tho bride to
the flower, but the flower to the bride.

92. hortulo, ‘pleasure-garden.’

93. staxe. Cf. Hor. Od. 1. ix, l :

⁸ Vides vt alta stet nive candidum
Soracce,'

where stet = ‘ stands out.' H

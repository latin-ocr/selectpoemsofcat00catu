GENERAL INTRODUOTION. xi

and speed. A few lines, when the passion is quieter,
may be translated 3—-

‘As soon as the wayworn company set foot on Cybele’s
demesne, spent with travel and fasting they fell asleep; aud
while their eyeh'ds were steeped in dull slumber's relaxing
swoon, rest gently charmed away the sever and frenzy of their
souls. But when the golden-visaged sun flashed forth his eyes
and began his survey of clear white sky, solid lande and the
waste of ocean, and routed the shades of night before the
rattling hoofs of his new-risen steeds,-that moment Sleep
hastily took ssight from the waking Attis, and rested not till
he found a haven in Queen Pasithea's bosom.'

Waking brings repentanoe 3 but repentance is re-
bellion against the goddess, who appears in her ehariot,
drawn by lions, to exeoute vengeanee. The poem
thus closes :—

‘Cybele spoke in anger; her hands drew back the yoke,
and the monster, summoning his might, sprang furiously
forward. Roaring in the eham, crashing through the under-
wood in his wild career, he came to the meist expanse of the
foam-fringed beach, discovered unmanned Attis by the bright
waters’ edge, and rushed upon him. Blind with terror he fied
· into the fastnesses of the forest, and there remained in bondage
for ever, until he died.

Great goddess, goddess Cybele, goddess and queen of Dindy-
mus! Grant, dear mistress, that thy sever may never light
upon my house: choose others for that headlong rout, drive
others on that passionate pilgrimage.⁷

The ‘Peleus’ and ‘Attis’ have been thought to
be translations3 if this be so, they have entirely
superseded their originals.

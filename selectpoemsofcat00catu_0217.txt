P. 62. Catullus’ friend, and companion in Bithynia-(X. 29), O.
Helvius Cinna, appears to have been a poet of the Alexandrino
school. His chief poem was the ‘Smyrna,' mentioned here,
dealing with the love of Myrrha and Cinyras. Its obscurity
was such that great glory accrued. to fihe critics who were
able to explain ila (Philargyrius on Verg. Ecl. IX. 35). Vix-gil
seems to have respected Cinna’s poetical power:

‘ Nam neque adhuc Vario videor nec dicere Cinna Diyna!

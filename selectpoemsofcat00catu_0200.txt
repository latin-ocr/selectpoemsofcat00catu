148 NOTES. LXVI.‚ 48-53

48. Chalybum. The Chalybes werc mythical smiths. For
the metm, cf. van. 44:

‘ Speret nec linquam e3se nec auriculam,'

and xcvn. 2. A fragment of the original survives τ

Χαλύβων ὡς ἀπόλοιτο γένος
γειόθευ ἀντέλλοντα κακὸν φυτὸν o'l μιν ἔφηναν,

ut, of strong wish or command. Cf. Hor. Sat. 11. i. 43:
‘J uppiter, ἰιι pereat positum robigine telum)

50. stringere = ‘make ductile‚’ ‘draw into bars’ (stricturae).

51. abjunctae mea fata. Cf. Cicero, meas absentis preces ,-
8011Ι111,ἶ τάμὰ δυστήνου κακά-θ common construction, especially
wit zpse.

comae sorores, ‘my sister looks were moaning my 111111,
who had just been severed from them.’
Ellis (less well) takes abjunctae with comae sorores.

52 et seq. ‘then there suddenly bore down upon me,
beating the air with waving pinions, Aethiopian Memnon‘s
only begotten brother, Locrian Arsinoe’s winged steed. He
caught me up, and flew on his way through the shadows of
the upper air, and laid me in Venus’ holy lap. On this errand
had our Lady of Zephyrium, the Greek denizen of Oanopus’
shores, despatched her own messenger; that not only to thy
honour, Ο god of wine, there should be fixed in heaven’s
spangled floor a golden crown from Ariadne's brows, but that
I also should gleam there, the consecrated spoils of a princess’s
auburn head,-therefore‚ passing damp from ocean to the
quarters of the gods, Ι was made by the goddess to take my
place as a new constellation among the old.'

53. umgena, ‘brothen’ Cf. LXIV. 301. Zephyrus is thus
the son of Eos, the mother of Memnon. The representation
of a wind as a ‘ winged horse’ is found in Verg. Aen. 11. 417,
‘Eois Eurus equis’ (compare Aen. 1. 52-63, where the winds
are spoken of in terms applicable to horses), Val. Flacc. 1. 608,
‘ Thraces equi' ( = winds from Thrace), Hor. Od. IV. iv. 44,
‘Eurus per Siculas equitavit undas‚’ and especially Eurip.
Phoen. 212, Ζεφύρου ἱππεύσαντος. That Zephyrus is meant is
confirmed by 57, ‘ suurn Zephyritis famulum.'

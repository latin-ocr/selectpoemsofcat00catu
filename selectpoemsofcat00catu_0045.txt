LIFE.

GAms VALEnms CATULLUS was born at Verona (87
or 84 B.c.), of 3 good family. We hear of his fat-her
38 the friend and frequently the host, of Julius Caesar.
The poet came to Rome as soon as he became his own
master, and there made 1118 settled home. There he
had bhe society of Calvus, Cinna, Cornificius, young
Asinius Pollio, Alfenus Varus, Caelius Rufus, and,
perhaps, Cicero ,- and there he fell into the toils of
Clodia, the wife of the consul Metellus Celer, and the
Lesbia of the poems. We hear of visits to his villa at
Tibur, to another villa at Sirmio, and also to Verona.
The pleasures of the bown seem to have kept him
always poor 3 and he followed the praetor Memmius to
Bithynia, which had newly become a Roman province,
111 the vain hope of mending his forbunes (57 B.C.). On
his homeward journey he went bo see his brother's
⁴ grave 111 bhe Troad, passed bhrough the famous ciues
of Asia, and returned in his yaoht 110 Sirmio (56 B.C.).
This retreat] 110 left for Rome, where he seems to have
spent the remainder of his short, life. We know that
he died young, perhaps (as is said) ae bhe age of thirssy ;
and, as his poems contain no certain allusion to events
of later date than 54 B.c.‚ we may believe that to have
been the year of his death.

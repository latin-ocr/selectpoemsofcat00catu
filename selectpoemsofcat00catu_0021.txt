GENERAL INTRODUOTION. xvii

may Ι beg the loan of your hearers for a littlc while? for I
want to go in state to the feast of Serapis.” “ Truce !'' cried I
to the lady, “when I spoke just now of chattels of mine I was
noffthinking. My dear friend, Caius Cinna, is the nomina]
purchaser : but whether things arc 1115 or mine is all one to
me ; for I use them as freely as if I bought for mysclf. You,
however, are a mischievous duuce and a plague, for you do
not forgive a slip of the tongue.'' ‘

Oatullus’ firm and close attachment to his friends is
one of the leading traits of his character. The feeling
of friendship was elevated by him into devotion,
demanding a complete and fervent faith on both
parts, and imposing in action a circle of attentions as
obligatory as religious exercises. Breach of duty was
not a sentimental injury, but sacrilege 3 an unfaithful
friend was not sickle, but an apostate. Such an apos-
tate the Varus¹ of the preceding poem proved to be.
Catullus shows in the following lines how deeply he
felt the blow :—

‘ Unfaithful Alfenus, betrayer of companions so linked to-
gether, has your hard heart no compassion left for your once-
cherished friend? Do you not tremble to cast me off, and
break your vows, like a traitor? Treachery is irreligion, and
finds no favour with the gods. Despising this truth, you
abandon me to my fate in a sea of troubles. What now must
poor humanity do? Where can its saith be placed ’ἰ .Did you
not yourself bid me give my beart to you, ingrate, inveigling
me into Love's perilous land by promises of perfect security?

1Α11011115 Varus, friend of the poets of this period, orator, and
leading lawyer‚ had been a cobbler at Cremona, He rose to the
consulate (39 B.c.); but Horace tells us that he remained n.

potential cobbler all his life. b

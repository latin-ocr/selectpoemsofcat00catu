APPENDlX l. 181

philosophy, and the simple lyrie, were soon left alone as in-
eorgptaflzible with thespiative mind. 'But the epila gud the elegiae
an e e 1 am 1 e new rowncesy eous e comuere‘,
could adogtgrRonlan laws‚ sbemit to and survive a {oman
reeonstruction. A loss of freedolu could be emupensated by
dignity, a loss of ease by symmetry, a loss of spontaueity by
preeision, a loss of nature by art. The transformatum of a
province and of poetry under Roman rule meant death to the
old forms, but regeneratiou into new forms of pen-fection. At
the same time, in both cases, some roem might still romain
sor regret; and we cannot but regret that others did not
arise to continue, after catullus, the freer growth, the more
fluent and natural and less artifieial maturity, of the Greek
elegaic. For he has left some whole poems and many passages
which show, like Caesar’s plane, what might have been but
for the “Ides of March.''

Of Catullus 642 elegiacs remain <mim-exn). Ovid’s rules,
such as the close of a thought with a couplet, the avoidanoe
of elision, especially in the latter half of both the hexameter
and the pentameter, the preponderance of dactyls, the ending
of the couplet with a dissyllable, which must be either noun
or verb, and the like, were not observed by Catullus. In the
hexameter he has 9 monosyllabic endings, 9 tetrasrsllubir, 9
dispondaic, 2 p11vzcasyllabic(nxv111. 105, XCVII. 5). One hexa-
meter (cxw. 3) consists of six spondees. ln the pentameter
there is one monosyllabic ending] (var ὃ). 63 trisyllabic end-
ings, 98 tetrasyllaba, 17 ρυιιίιιεμίίαόἰε, l heptasyllabic (vaxu.
72) ; aud 34 adjectival endings. Elisiou occurs between the
first and second halves of the pentameter 16 times3 hiatus
thriee.

J. The few peculiarities of Catullus* l'uosonY are :-

(α) The lengthening of a short final vowel before two con·
sonants in THESIS: Propontida- crucem ιν. 9, ιἰηροίςιιιέαχνεειι 18,
· nefaria scripta XLIV. 18, modo scurra xxu. 12, ultima Britan-
nia xxnc. 4 ; in ARSIS, si poce stolidum xvn. 24, yelida stabula
Lxm. 53, nulla spes Lxlv. 187.

(β) That a short final syllable is lengthened thriee before
hymenaeus mm. 4, wa. 20, llxvr. ll. See also LXI. 223 note.

(γ) Hiatus occurs LXVI. ll. novo auctus, and (shortenlng
the preceding long vowel) ιν. 4 te in, cmv. 6 mod& (abl.) ipse.

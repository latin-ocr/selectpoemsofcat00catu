Although the pronunciation οἱ the aspirate, at the end of
the Republic, seems, according to Cicero (Orator XLVIII„ διο.)
to have varied according to quickly changing fashion; and
although a difference was made between the vulgarity of
aspirating vowels and aspirating consonants unduly3 yet
extravagance in both appears to have been condemned as a
popular error. Arrius, it is to be remarked, errs in both
ways, and Catullus affirms the error to have been traditional
'm his less than undistinguished family. Hence the vulgarity
of speech attaching to Arrius was similar to that now found
in the uneducated provincial or the eockney.

The worship of the ‘ Great Mother ‘ (whom Lucretius iden-
tifies with Tellus, giving an explanation of the allegorical
elements of her procession, 11. 600), was introduced into Rome
from Phrygia, in obedience to a command of the Sibylline
books, 203 Rc. Her image, a small black stone, was brought
from Pesshzuffl a town on the slope of Dindymus ; in her
honour a temple was built, and the games called Meyalesza
established.

There is nothing, however, that is specially Roman iu the
treatment of her cultus in the present poem. Every allusion
is essentially Greek ; and all internal evidence would allow, if
indeed it does not suggest, that we have here a translation of
a lost Greek model. The ἅπαξ λεγόμενα, such as heclerz'yerae
properipedem, silvicullrim, nemorivayzm, erzjfuyae, would then
he attempts to render the Greek compounds of the original ;
so soro, v. 60, is used in the sense of ἁγόρα, the associatione
oi which word (and not at all those of the Latin sorum) are
intended to be presented. Roman literature on the subject
of the magma mater, it is also to be remarked‚ contains no
allusion to Attis, down to the date of the present poem; of
which we may at least affirm, that in versification‚ phraseology,
and conception, it is essentially Greek.

The distinctive features of the worship of Cybele were an
enthusiastic excitement, amounting to madness (μαίνεσθαι τῇ
θεῶ), fasting, and self-castration. Attis, here a Greek youth,
not a god, is represented as leaving his home under an irresis-
tible impulse which had seized him as a devotee of the Idaean
Mother; as erossing the Aegean; as landing near the Phrygian
Ida ; and as penetrating the forests, that clothe the mountain
to its summit, the sacred abode of the goddess, whence he is
suffered to return no more.

ever, and the poison of his history was his love of
Lesbia, or, to take off the mask, Clodia. The sister of
Cicero’s enemy Clodius, the wife—but suspiciously

when he ceased to be lover he ceased to be poet.

The existing poems cannot be arranged in order of
composition. Probably Catullus, like most other
poets, began with imitation and translation. But it
is necessary to suppose that his brother-'s death
occurred quite early in Oatullus' short life—a sup-
position in which there are difficulties—if we would
place the extant translations among his first compo-

the ‘Dialogue with a Door,’ and the rest of these
pieces, are not the best works of Catullus, we must
praise them as elever exeroises, and pass on to his

The longest of these is the idyll on the ‘ Marriage
of Peleus and Thetis) The argument is very simple:
the Argo breaking for the first time the silence of the
scas—the sea-nymphs rising to the strange sight—the

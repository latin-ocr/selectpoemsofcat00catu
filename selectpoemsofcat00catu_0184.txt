132 NOTES. LXIV„ 101-124.

101. Quanto, ‘how much paler did she often grow than
gold's pale brightness ! ' For ablative of amount in compari-

son see Roby, Lat. Gr. 1204.

104. ³ Not without return, however, and not in vain were
the warm vows breathed by her sweet silent lips as she offered
to the great gods her girlish sacrifices.'

105. succendit. In Latin the metaphoris often contained
in the verb, where we should express it in noun or adjective.
The common emendation is succepit (tritum pro novo atquc
eleyante). Munro, however, thinks succendit has no mean-

ing.

l 137). conigeram, ‘with its burden of eones and its resinous ⁴
2ar .

108. contorquens robur, ‘ wrenching the strong timber!

109. exturbata, ‘ dislodged by the roots, it falls far from its
seat, crown downwards, and orushes au things round with its

leaves in its death-agony.’

110. comis obit omnia. The MSS. give cameius obvia, or
omnia. with alternative obvia above. Munro reads corneis obit
obvia ( :obstacles); Rossbach, et cominus. There are many
other emendations more remote from the MSS.

P. 38. 116. error, ‘lest he should be baulked by the struo-
&il-6³57 undistinguishable maze.’ Of. Verg. Aen. v. 591.

120. laeta, is the MSS. reading, for which Ellis adopts
(malqrc soi) Conington’s feeble and inappropriate ‘lamentata

est' instead of Lachmann's laetabatur, ‘Who took in her
daughter an ill-starred overmastering joy.'

122. ratis. Lachmann’s rati is attractive3 but we have
rate, LXIII. 1.

123. Venerit, so Lachmann supplies the wanting verb.

124. immemori. Cf. xxx. 1 note.

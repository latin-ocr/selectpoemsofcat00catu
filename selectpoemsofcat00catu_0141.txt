13. tritiuS, ‘ of finer grain’ ; or ‘ more dexterous' (cf.
νρίβων),-ει rare and doubtful use. The MSS. read tristius, for

tersius or tertius = ‘ more polished.⁷

aut si quid.. Cf. xm. 10 note.

way, and there is no man whom you may not see to be in

our own in the half that hangs behind us. Cf. Phaedrus IV.
10.1 A possible translation is, ‘ that which is in the back of
the wallet‚' i.e., ‘proprium vitium? But Munro strongly
supports the other rendering, ‘ the half of the wallet which is
on his back‚’ by comparing Verg. Aen. 1x. 274, campi quod
rex habet, Luer. IV. 372, quod liquimus ejus, ete.

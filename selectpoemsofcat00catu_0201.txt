NOTES. LXVI.‚ 54-73. 149

Another interpretation, which seems duc to ‘too much
learning,' is given by Orelli. Arsinoe, wife of Ptolemy
Philadelphus, is represented as riding on an ostrich, in a
statue ab Helicon. Probably there was a similar statue in
the temple of Arsinoe-Venus, on the Libyan promontory of
Zephyrium. Then Ππίρεηα Memnonis z the bird risen from
the ashes of Memnon, and will be the ostrich. Ellis suggests
another bird, a kind of hawk.

54. Arsinoe, wife of Ptolemy 11.‚ was deified as Arsinoe-
Aphrodite. A temple was built to her on one of the promon-
tories called Zephyrium ι hence she is called Zephyritis, v. 57.
There was a Zephyrium in the district of Oyrenae, anciently
a Locrian settlement; hence perhaps thc epithet Locridos
(Elocridicos, MSS).

59. En dfl uen ibi, MSS. The simplest emendation is
‘ Dive, tibist &c., i.e.‚ Bacche, who is spoken of simply as deus

Ellis reads ‘ H ic juveni Ismario’ = Baccho, but this loses us
the undoubtedly sound and picturesque vario.

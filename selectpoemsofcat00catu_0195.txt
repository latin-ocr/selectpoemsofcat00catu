NOTES. LXV„ 9-23. 143

9. This verse is omitted in ahnost all M SS. Munro would
fill up the lacuna, ‘ Nunquam 6110 le primae mihi ademptum in
flore juventae,' which Catullus might have written. If the text
stand, the word lacking before loquentem may have been
sacca (Voss) ; audiero is irregular in tense (andito ἓ). Cf. lx.
6 for sentiment.

12. canam, ‘ sings songs ever saddcned by thy death.' The
MSS. have tegam, ‘ veil in silence ’ (Ellis). But it is hard to
understand what this could mean, and Munro ingeniously
explains the genesis of the corruption.

13. concinit, ‘ sings for ever.’

14. Daulias cf. Thuc. 11. 29. Procne, wife of Tereus,
who ruled in Daulis of Phocis, slew, in a fit of resentment,
her husband’s son, Itys or Itylus. After the deed she was
changed into a bird, the swanw or the nightingale, and
doomed for ever to ‘bewail the cruel end of lost Itylus.'

16. expressa, ‘translated’

Battiadae = of Callimachus, who called himself heir of
Battus Cf. vn. 4.

23. Atque. Aul. Gellius (X. 29) says that atque has the un-
usual sense of statim in the lines of Virgil (modelled on the
present passage) occurring Geor. 1. 201-:3 :

‘ Non aliter quam qui adverso vix flumine lembum
Remiyiis subigyit, εἰ bracchia forte remisit
Atque illum in praeceps prono rapit alveus amni)

of Caesar, he seems to have employed his opportunities to
amass wealth. Cicero, in a letter to Atticus (vn. vii. 6), speaks
of Mamurra⁷s wealth, with bitterness. His luxury, however,
(⁴ primus parieles aedium marmoreis laminis praetexit. solido
marmore columnas erexit‚') and his debauchery (XXIX. XLI.)
seem to have left him always poor. From this poem and the
next it appears that he obtained a saltus (i.e.‚ an assignation
of 800 juyera of land) near Firmum, a town of Picenum ς but
that only a small portion of this estate was lucrative. Com-
pare cxv.:
‘ Mentula habet instar triqinta juyera prati,
Quadrafflnta arv& cetera sunt maria.
Cur non divitiis Croesum superare poti-3 sic,
Uno qui in saltu cot bona possideat—
Prata, arva, inflent& silvas latasque paludes
Usque ad Hyperboreos et mare ad Oceanum.’

game.

4. fructus, ‘ he exceeds his returns by his expenditure.

5. concedo. ‘ Therefore I grant he is rich, if you will grant
that he wants everything: let us admire the many acres, so
long as the master lacks one measure.’

6. modo. There is a play on the two senses of modus.- (1) a
‘measure of land,' (2) moral ‘measure,’ ‘sels-controL' The
final syllable of modo is shortened in the hiatus. Cf. Verg.
Ecl. vm. 108, Aen. VI. 507, Lv. 4, X. 27.

XII.

1. Asinius Marrucinus' only claim to immortality is hin
pilfering habit here stigmatised, for he is nowhere else m-en-
tioned. He was probably elder brother of G. Asinius Pollio,
who justified Catullus’ praise by becoming friend of Virgil
and Horace, and eminent as soldier, senator, advocate, his-
toriam and tragic dramatist: see Hor. Od. 11. i.

Compare, on these petty thefts, xxv„ Mart. xii. xxix.

Marr. Asini. Compare Hor. Od. 1. vi. 1, Crispe Sallusti
δια, and see x. 30 note.

7-9. ‘ Who would sink a whole talent to have your felonies
compounded ; for he is a boy of fluent wit and humour.'

leporum disertus puer, a rare usage. ἡ

Α genitive of quality may be used when the substantive
expressing the quality is accompauied by an adjective. Thus
we ean say ‘munus maximi risus (XVII. 7), centum puer artium
(Hor. Od. IV. i. 15) litus amoeni secessus (Juv.· 111. 4). But we
may not say munus risus, puer artium, litus secessus. It seems,
however, that if a substantive be attended by an adjective (as
puer by disertus here) a simple genitive of quality is allowable,
though very unemmnon. Thus iu Verg. Ecl. IV. 24, we have
‘sullam herba veneni) The whole phrase may then be said to
weld itself together, as ‘ treacherously poisonous herb,’
‘fluently witty boy.' The same rules apply to the ablativo
as to the genitive of description ς and in the same way we
have en e>ltception in Cat. LXIV. 50 (see note), and another
prom. Hrgi.

Ellis, however, makes leporum directly follow disertus =
‘ fiuent,’ or perhaps ¹ discerning, in matters of wit and fun ’-

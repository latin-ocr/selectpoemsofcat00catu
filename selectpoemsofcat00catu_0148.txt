9. ‘And by this my lady saw that she, with merry wit,
offered the worst oi all things to the gods.' Nothing to
Catullus was so vile as a bad poet’s worst writings. The
wit of Lesbia was shown, not merely in sacrificiug the worst
things to the gods, but in valuing so contemptuously a recon-
ciliation with Catullus.

Other translations might be given: (α), ‘the sweet sinner
(pessima puella) saw that this (i.e., Annales Volusi) was the
sacrifice she promised, in her flash of frolic, to the gods ’ ; (β),
‘ this vow to the gods my wicked lady knew to be merry and
witty.’ But (α) would require lacteo,- and both (α) and (β) would
harshly give to pessimi and pessima different meaniugs.

Mr. Munro writes : “ Hoc, Ι feel sure, is an accusative—hoc
jocose vovere z hoc jocosum votum vovere. Pessima, Ι believe,
goes with puella. I have a strong persuasion that Baehrens,
in his Analecta Oatull„ is right, and that the poem has no
proper point, unless we suppose that the poet is jocularly per-
verting Lesbia's proposal. She meant that, in order to her
being reconciled to Catullus, first of all, the poems v‘ pessimi
poetae,’ i.e., the poems which Catullus himself, the ‘ pessi-
mus poeta,' naughtiest of poets, had written against herself,
should be burnt. The poet chooses to take ‘pessimus poeta)
in the sense of ‘worst of poets‘ aud turns it against poor
Volusius.’‘ The objections to this are, that the purpose of
Lesbia’s vow was to cause Catullus to cease his lampoons (5),
which could hardly be done by burning the old ones; and,
secondly, that this interpretation gives no force to the
emphatic ‘ electi-ssima,’ which surely means ‘ the most carefully
picked,' i.e., the very worst specimens of the worst poet.
These Catullus decides to be the ‘Annales Volusi.’

spirit haunts hallowed Idalium' (a grove in Cyprus) ‘and
Urii, wide of prospect' (near Brundisium), ‘and Ancon' (in
Picenum), ‘ and reedy Cnidos' (a city of Caria), and Amathus
and Golgi' (cities of Cyprus), ‘and Dyrrhachium' (formerly
Epidamnus), ‘the hostel of the Adriatic ; grant an acceptance

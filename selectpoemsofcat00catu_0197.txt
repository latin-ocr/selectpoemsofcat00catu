NOTES. LXVI., 1-7. 145

Berenice’s grief. A weak sister may weep for the departure
of a soldier-brother, but will her anguish be so terrible as
that of Berenice? Besides, Berenice was never weak, and the
great instance of her strength of mind was shown in order to
secure—her husband. Her grief, too, takes forms best expressed
in the Lover’s vocabulary. Then the Lock begins to exliibit
its own vanity by the use of strong terms, mock-heroic‚ if
words ever were so. It is vowed to the gods as the chief
sacrifice—together with a hecatonib. The result of a great
war is dismissed in a few words, our chief concern, of course,
being to come to the fate of a ringlet. The Lock protests
(swearing‚ too naturally, by the head it grew on) that it
yielded only to irresistible force, and aids its grandiose phrase-
ology τηαφιὶὲ componendo parra, following with a general con-
demnation of steel, very pardonable in a victim— of the shcars.
'Phe Lock's apotheosis is next described in a highly exalted
tone, emphasized by an ample use of proper names, by a com-
parison of itself to (no less an one than) Ariadne, and by a
bombastic account of its present sublime position. A strong
protest is added to show its continued devotion to its mistress,
a condescension so worded as to make us feel

‘ Methinks our lady doth protest too much.'

Lastly, its present majesty is marked by the demand for
solemn oblations (to be accepted, too, from chaste votaries
only), and then is degraded by the confession that the reason

fpr de.m³¹lndi¹¹g these sacrificial offerings is—to make the other

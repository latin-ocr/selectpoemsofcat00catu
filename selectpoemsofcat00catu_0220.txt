Ol.
See General Introduction IL, p. xxv.
4. advenio.. ,1ιῂ . . . alloquerer: for sequence of tenses cf. CXVI. 3.

7. interea is difficult. It seems to mean, ‘till Ι can do
more.' Rossbach emends to ‘in terra leae) The gifts were
perhaps a look of hair, flowers, &o

10. ave atque vale, the formula of farewell to the dead.
So Aeneas says, at Pallas’ funeral, Aen. XL 97:
‘ Salve aeternum mihi, maxime Palla,
A el< mumque vale. ⁷

ΟΠ.
1. tacito . . . . cujus. . . . anim. ‘If a true friend ever
entrusted aught to the silent keeping of another, whose deep-
seated loyalty was known to the core, you both shall find me

sworn by their oath, and must believe me to have become the
very god of silence.'

3. morum, not tacitorum quorum fides ποία sit (Ellis), but
the two true sworn friends, between whom the secret is held.
Munro alters to tacite, and refers the plural illorum to the
generic notion contained in fido amico, a construction of which
of course there are plenty of examples (cf. LXIV. 146 note) in
both Greek and Latin. But this seems to spoil the point of
‘tacito—Harpocratem'3 and v. 2 would be rather a feeble
amplification of fido, whereas it goes excellently with tacito in
sense, making both the amici to be fidi, and so leading up to
their union in illorum. For tacito used practically as a sub·
stantive, cf. LXIV. 176 note.

meque . . . . et. Cf. Lxxw. ll, teque . . . . et.
4. Harpocratem. = the god of silence (Lxxrv. 4).

puta. Remark the rare collocation of imperative with
indicative (invenies).

CVII.

l. 81 cui quid . . . . proprie. ‘If ever answer came to
anxious prayer, when hope was gone, then is it welcome, in
the truest sense, to the soul.'

never the case. Compare the third and fourth lines of the
following passage in Tibullus, a locus classicus:

‘ Lutea sed niveum involvat membrana libellum,
Pumeoel cui canas tondeat ante comas,

Summaque praetexat tenuis vestiyz'a cartae,
Iudicat ut nomen littera facta tuum,

A tque inter =qeminas pinyarztztr cornua frontes.'

Here the frontes are the ends of the roll. Cf. also Mart. nt
10, Ovid. Trist. 11. 1.

Ellis and other editors alter without occasion to membrana,
but 8 refers summarily to all portions of the book before
mentioned. Munro would punctuate after membranae, and
connect 8 with what follows, finding otherwise no meaning in
the verse. But haec more naturally begins the sentence3 aud
8 summarises the elaborate perfection of the external ‘ get-up ’
of these unfortunate poems.

9. haec cum legas ‘ as often as you read these verses.'

Bellus, ἂψ, ‘fine and city-bred gentleman.⁷ Urbanus
signifies the polished manners and lively talk of Rome, in
contrast to the heaviness and dulness of the country.

10. unus, ‘ordinary,’ ‘mcre,’ as unus e multis: cf. umus
paterfamilias, Cic. de Or. 1. 132, unus manipularis, ad'Att.
lx, x,

11. rursus Σ reversus: ‘ drops to an ordinary ditcher: so
unlike himself, so changed does he become.’

Abhorret, so. α se: ‘so inconsistent with himself is he.’
But of this use there are no other instances, and therefore
Munro would take the word generally = ‘ so absurd is he.'

mutat, intransitive.

12. scurra z ‘a practised wit,’ much like urbanus, with
which it is combined, Plaut. Most. Ι. i. 14:

‘ Tu urbanus vero scurra, deliciae popli,
Rus mihi. tu objectas.'

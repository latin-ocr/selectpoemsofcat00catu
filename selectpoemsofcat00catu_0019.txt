GENERAL INTRODUOTION. xv

blessing than when the cords of care are snapt, and the mind
lets slip its burden-when, spent with toil in far-off places,
we come to our home sanctuary and find rest on the long-
dreamed-of couch'? This moment is cheaply bought even by
such costly pains. Welcome, lovely Sirmio! make merry
before your master! make merry too, ye waves of the water
of Lydia! and let every jocund echo with which home is
haunted break into laughing !’

WE pass now to the consideration of the personal
poems of Catullus, in which he has immortalized, by
truthsully recording‚ his sincere affecffions, passionate
love, genuine hatreds, clear wit, and hearty merriment.

It was truly felt at this period, by all who were not
content to pass their lives in lethargy, that there was
only one place on earth where active existence was
possible to a man 3 that it was better to struggle and
starve at Rome than hatten on the pastures of all the
rest of the world. There, and there alone, could be
found news, amusement, politica] agitation, society—-
'in a word, a life worth the trouble of living. How
much more enjoyment than could be afforded by the
stalled ox of provincial dulness was promised to him-
self by Catullus, when he invited his friend to dine
with him off wit and a bare cupboard, in these lines:—

‘ You shall dine nobly at my table, Fabullus, in a few days,
granting your stars are favourable, if you bring a noble and
ample dinner with you—sunny maiden, and wine, and salt.

xii GEN ERAL INTRODUOTION.

The two ‘Marriage Songs' may now be meu‘oioned.
One of these has no special occasion, or at least} con-
tains no names. The form is that of a dialogue between
the parts of a double chorus—the young men invoke,
13116 maidens reproach, the evening star 3 the latter sing

married state. Maidenhood, the maidens say,

‘is a flower that grows in a corner within garden walls,
never discovered by flocks, never bruised by the plough3 to
which the breezes add sweebness and the sun strength and
the rains statur&

Not. so, their anbagonisbs reply 3 say rather—

“ an unwedded vine, struggling on (111 unsheltered soil—
never able 130 raise her head, or rear bhe mellow chisto-r, but

boiving her delicabe {rame in drooping heaviness until the
bopmost fiendril almost clasps the root.''

Catullus' mastery of the language of flowers brings

feeling. For in the other Epithalamium, written for
bhe marriage of Manlius to Vinia, the bride stands
pre-eminent, ⁴among the beauty of the world-

‘ as the stately hyacinth-bloom rises in a rich man‘s many-
coloured garden of fiowers.'

And ‘ignin—

‘He shall be folded in thy embrace as closely as fihe limbes·

Continuous rapid music characterizes this Hymeneal

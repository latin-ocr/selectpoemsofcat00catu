munere isto, ‘for your wicked present.' If at the Satur-
nalia, the Roman equivalent (if not the origin) of our Christmas
festivity, you received a book as a present, you were bound
by etiquette to read it.

3. odio vatimano = ‘as Vatinius hates you,’ ‘with all the
spleen of Vatinius.’ Ellis prefers an allusion to Vatinius’
notorious un opularity3 if this is meant, render ‘as Vatinius
” is hated.’ ut, as Vatinius had such special reason to hate
Calvus, the former interpretation seems preferable.

ὀὶ “that you should wilfully poison me with such a dose of
poe s.

7. impiorum. ‘ this heap of outcasts ’ who write dis invitis.

8. ‘ But if, as I shrewdly guess, this original and exquisite
offering is a gift to you from the pedant Sulla.'

Α dat = dedit. Cf. Verg. Aen. IX. 266:
'’ ‘ Cratera antiquum, quem dat Sidonia Dido.

Remark tristi, LXVI. 30, where however the syllable contracted
is -υἱε, not -sis.

continuo, ‘forthwithss Ellis compares, however, Ov. Fasti.
v, 734, VI. 720, where ‘continua die,' continua modest = ‘next
day,' ⁴ next night.' If continuo die be taken in the same way
here, the present must have come on the eve of the Saturnalia,
and this would certainly agree with v. 17, εἰ luzerz't. Mr.
Munro now thinks continuo is the adjective.

AD VERTISEMENT ΤΟ ΤΕΧΤ. xlv

eima verba of Catullus are in some cases very different
from the mutilated presentations of the extant codices.
But it would be inadvisable to admit into a text even
attractive readings which differ widely from those of
our best, if still inadequate‚ authorities. The following
text will be found to adhere (except in undoubted ccr-
rections) to the best MSS.; which have been made
accessible by recent and most valuable apparatus
critici, especially that of ELLIS.

In spelling, all peeuliarities have been avoided.
These occur largely in the extant MSS„ and some of
them may have been derived from early MSS„ but the
probability is infinitely remote that they are Catullian.
For the purposes of the present edition, their retention
would be worse than useless. The use ofj and v for
the consonantal i aud u may be pardoned on the score
of convenience.

NOTES. LXIV„ 41-52. 129

the district in which the people were already living : hence
the sense of the passage, as well as metrica} reasons, would

condemn the MSS. Pharsaliam.

trequentant, ‘ throng‚’ ⁴ crowd.'

41. prono, ‘the bull does not rend the sod with the deep-
sunk share.'

143.hs’qualida, ‘scales of rust steal over the forgotten
poug .

44. recessit, ‘far as the rich palace revealed its chambers’
—literally ‘went back'

46. ‘ The thrones are of white ivory, the tables bear glitter-
ing cups.’ Soliis is said to be dative, like Verg. Aen. VI.
603, and so also mensae (Ellis). But the passage quoted is as
ambiguous as the present. It is therefore safer to translate,
‘Ivory gleams on the thrones, and the vessels of the table
glitter together.’ It is also just conceivable that mensae is

locative.

48. pulvinar geniale, ‘ the holy couch of consummation)
Pulvinar is used only of the conch of a god.

49. sedibus in medus, ‘ in the middle hall.’

Indo dente politum, ‘made of polished Indian tusk.' Cf.
‘ pictas abiete puppes,⁷ Verg. Aen. v. 633 (quoted by Muuro) ε
‘poops of painted pine.’ Cf. Id. 1. 655. See xxi. 9 note.

51. variata, ‘pictured with antique shapes of men) Cf.
160, prisci praecepta parentis. In both cases there seems a
kind of hypallage, for ‘ shapes of men of old, ‘ antique injunc-
tions of thy sire.'

52. virtutes (vam. Β. 50 (90) ‘virum ει virtutum omnimn'
Verg. Aen. 1. 566 ‘virtutesque virosque) may be used here as
an equivalent of ἀρεταί in the sense of ‘glories‘z compare
Euripides—so often imitated by Catullus—Herc. Fur. 357-8,
γενναίων δ’ ἀρεταὶ πόνων τοῖς θανοῦσιν ἄγαλμα, said of heroes,
and cf. Hom. Π. 1. 189, κλέα ἀνδρῶν. Or (but differently) it
may mean ‘ acts of virtue,' or ‘ valour,' like audaciae ‘ acts of
boldness,’ Cic. pro Sulla, 27.

1. ‘ Goddesses of beauty, gods of passion, and all there are
among men of finer feeling, come and mourn.'

This poem has been often imitated, often translated. It is
a characteristic specimen of Catullus' style, showing the
natural symmetry of his thought, the simple directness of his
expression. After the invocation, half the poem tells the
preciousness and the graces of the bird, half the sadness of its
lot and the bereavement of its mistress. The words are so
unaffected, and their order seems so spontaneous,

‘ut sibi quivis
Speret idem, sudet multum frustraque laboret
Ausus idem.'

2. quantum, ὅτε. See Appendix II. 1. a. on Catullus¹
phraseology.

7.1psam Ellis bids us take with matrem, ‘as well as the
child knows her very mother) But suam is thus left incom-
p31ete and it is awkward and unCatullian to say ipsam tam
bene quam for tam bene quam ipsam. Lachmann would read
‘ipsass Suam zpsam = ‘his own mistress)

8. sese is emphatic z ‘ nor would he dislodge himself?

13. at used in sudden imprecation: cf. XXVIII. 142

‘ Aa vobis mala multa (li deaeque
Dent, opprobria Romuli Remique.'

‘ Out! shame upon you, shameful shades of Orcus, that swallow
in your depths all pretty things !’

17. tua opera, ‘by your doing,' ‘you are to blame that.’
The phrase, in usage, conveys an idea of reproach: compare
ῗηίἒά ’PhiL ΙΙ. §23‚ where ‘opera ‘mea' is coupled with ‘culpa

18. ‘My mistress' sweet eyes are sadly swollen and red with
tears.' Flendo .· so fando: ‘ with words' (Verg. Aen. ΙΙ. 6.)

turgiduli. Catullus uses diminutive nouns, proper names¹
adjectives, and even verbs ε see Appendix Π. 2.

NOTES. X.. 27-29. 79

Many emendations have been suggested ; as Hand's
‘ Istos: commodum enim volo ad Sarapim'

where da is understood before Istos, and commodum z: just in
time3 or Munro’s‘ commode enim’— = comfortably3 or Ellis’
Ucommoneam Volo' (com. = ‘give an order to).'
The worship of Serapis came from Sinope to Alexandria,
thence, with other Egyptian cults, to R,ome in the last
years of the Republic.

27. mane me = ‘ not so fast.’

The shortening of mane} (cf. ςαυὲ, L. 18) has cast 3 doubt on
this line. Emendations are: ‘mane‘ inquii (Ellis); minime
inquii (Lachmann, sce.) 3 mi anime (Bergk) 3 and ‘ memini‘
inquio (Munro).

28.1stud=0cto homines rectos, cf. 14, quod illia natum
dicitur esse, and is directly governed by paravit 30, the inter-
vening clauses, expressive of the poet' s haste and p iturbation,
for a moment interrupting the construction, which' is resumed
by ιε.

Munro makes quod a conjunction: ‘when Ι said just now
that Ι had them) Ellis makes istud and quod refer to the

{logish me ’haberes‘ as for what Ι happened to say, i.e. that Ι

29. ‘A dear friend of mine is Cinna, I mean Gaius Cinna,
he it was bought them for himself. But whether things are
his or mine, is all one to me—I use them as freely as if Ι have
bought for myself.' Quam seems to z quam si, of which there
is no other example. Even if it were possible, Munro, who,
after Achilles Statius, emends to paratis (nent. abl. plu. of

· participle), objects that the proper tense after si (expressed

or omitted) would be parassem. This would undoubtedly be
the common and conventional form. But if we had (or could
understand) the si, the thought would be rather different, and
would be, ‘I use his property as freely as whatever Ι may
have bought for myself,' where pararim would be the regular
tense. And this suggests the reading quae for Quam [as in
vanl. B.‚ 88 (128) quam quae must be read for quam quam,
MSS.]; in which case the sense would be, ‘I use no more
freely my own property.’

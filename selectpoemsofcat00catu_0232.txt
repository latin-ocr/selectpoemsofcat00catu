180 APPENDIX Ι.

5. Catullus ends a verse with a monosyllable twice, LXII. 45,
LXIV. 315 3 Virgil 28 times ς Lucretius often—all violating the
law which requires the coincidence of verbal accent and
metrical ictus at the close of the verse. One (Lxlv. 55) two
‹lz'ssyllables (not dispondaic) break the same law: in the
Georgics thrice‚ at least, and a dozcn times in the last books
of the Aeneid. A tetrasyllable (not dispondaic) occurs twice
111 an. (hymenaeus), the same word being found in a similar
position in LXIV. twice, and calathi-sci once. Virgil has hy-
menaeus· at the end of a verse 10 times, hyacinthus 5 times ε
but also ululatu, lacrimasque. These also involve a discord-
anee of ictus aud aceent, and (before the lasz two Greek
words) a lengthening of a short syllable. Virgil of course
freely ends with similar tetrasyllables when they are proper
names. Once in an„ twice in LXIV„ the last word 15 penta—

6. Of elisione between fourth and fifth foot there are 2 111
an„ 9111 wa. These are not rare in Lueretius or Virgi]
(que is generally the clicled syllable). Elisions between fifth
and sarth feet appear 01166 111 LXH„ 5 times in wa. z they
are not at all avoided by Lucretius, and he is occasionally
imitated by Vix-gil, but rarely, 111 this respect. Catullus,
generally, is less harsh 111 1115 611510115 111 his hexameters than
in his other metres.

7. There 15 0116 Hypermeter in Catullus (LXIV. 298) as there
is one in Lucretius (v. 849„ Virgil has about a acore, the
last syllable being in all but two cases «lue.

Η. 111 Catullus, alone among Latin poets, the macone
retains its original form, its Greek fr,eedom ease and elas-
ticity. In other hands, even in those of Propertius, but more
than all in the hands of Ovid, this metre became Latinized,

oligginality of the Roman genius nowhere reveals itself 50
clearly, to just examination, as in the 1156 which it made of

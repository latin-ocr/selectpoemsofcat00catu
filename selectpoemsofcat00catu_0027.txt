GENERAL INTROD‘UOTIO N. xxiii

deception‚ he confronted the reality. He knew the
delusion was of his own creation 3 and. his detestation
of the cause was almost mixed with wonder at its
power. But he cannot forgive Cloclia3 much less
Rufus, the author of his destruction. He persecutes
both with a venom and brutality of purpose only
explicable on the principle that the corruption of the
best thing is the worst.

Yet in spite of the blight which thus fell upon the
life of Catullus, there were some feelings which still
remained fresh and. healthy. His tender attentions to
his friends and to his brother’s memory still remained
in leaf. The brother died at an early age, and was
buried in the Troad — ‘ that neutral graveyard of
Europe and Asia) Catullus made a pilgrimage to the
tomb‚ where all that made his life worth living was
laid, and his words then spoken will make a fitting
conclusion :—

‘ Dear brother, Ι have passed through many peoples, I have
crossed many seas, and I am here, at these untimely obsequies‚
that I may deliver to thee death’s last tribute, and waste
fruitless words on dust that cannot answer. For I know that

‘blind chance has stolen away from 1116 thy living self, O my
poor brother, so loved and yet lost by me! Behold ! these
despairing sacrifices, which old custom on this soil enjoins,
take, Ι pray thee——they are made wet with a brother's tears.
And thus I greet thee and bid thee farewell, brother. for
evermore.’

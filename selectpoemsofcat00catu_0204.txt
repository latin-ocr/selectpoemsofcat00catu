that Lesbia was multiplying her immoralities, then Manlius
was hardly acting as a man of the world, or even as a friend,
'm telling tales to Catullus in his absence from her. But both
these interpretations of the text are arbitary.

Manlius is staying at or near lerona, where Catullus is
visiting his father’s house, and is thus a sort of guest of
Catullus. He writes to the poet saying he is in great distl ess
(of what origin there is little to show, but probably 1n part
from ill-health1), and fecls sadly the loss of his wife' s society,
and asks for some light modern literature or love· p-oems of
Catullus' own to soothe his loneliness Catullus replies that
he cannot send love-poems of his own, because his taste for
these has been checked and changed by his brother's recent
death. So, too, Manlius’ hint, that Verona is not a becoming
place for a man of pleasure and of ton, is sadly answered. Nor
can the poet send books, because he has left his library behind
in Rome. Had he been able to grant, he would have antici-
pated, both requests of Manlius.

That Manlius was near Verona is shown by hospitis officium,
v. 12, by laic, v. 28, answering Catullus’ own word huc, v. 36,
and by ultro deferrem: for how was Catullus likely to have
taken books and poems to Manlius unasked, unless he had
come, as a stranger or visitor requiring attention, into
Catullus’ neighbourhood ’ἓ

Π Manlius' distress had arisen from the loss of his young
bride, Catullus would probably have said something more
dlistinct, and certainly would have sent in consolation some-

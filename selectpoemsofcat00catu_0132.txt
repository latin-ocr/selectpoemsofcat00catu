80 NOTES. X.‚ 33. XL, 1-3.

cinna-est Gaius = ‘ Cinna, I mean Gaius Cinna‚' as distin-
guished from some other Cinna (cf. xcv.). This punctuation
follows a suggestion of Mr. Munro. The common reading,
Cinna est Gaius, is very harsh. For although the transposition
of praenomen and nomen is found often in Lucilius (cf.
‘Cornelius Lucius Scipio Barbatus' Inscr. scip), and occa-
sionally but rarely iu later poets, and although the trans-
position of nomen and coynomen (cf. XI1. 1) is common, even
in prose, when only these two names are used, yet an inver-
sion of praenomen and coynomen seems unexampled.

33. ‘But you are excessively stupid and tiresome, for
refusing to admit a slip of the tongue) Male sometimes=
‘very,’ with words of negative meaning: see Horace's male
dispari, Od. 1. xvii. 25 ; male parvus, Sat. 1. 111. 45, &c
With words of positive meaning male z parum, as diyito male
pertinaci, Hor. Od„ 1. xi. 24 3 male fida, Verg. Aen. 11. 253
male sanem, &a

1. Catullus begs his acquaintance, Furius and Aurelius
(xv., XVI„ XXI„ XXIII„ XXVI.), who have sworn eternal
inseparable friendship with him, to do him a little service,
and carry to Lesbia his final repudiation of her. He is em-
bittered by her infidelity, and this explains the half ironical
tone of liis address to his friends, which suggests a doubt
of their saith too. This is evidently, from its allusions,
one of Catullus' latest poems; for Caesar did not go to
Britain till 55 Rc. The difference between the treatment
of the Sapphie metre by Catullus and Horace is shown in
Appendix Ι. D.

comites G„ ‘ pledged to be Catullus' comrades.'

ut = ‘ where‚' a rare but undoubted usage. Cf. XVII. 10:

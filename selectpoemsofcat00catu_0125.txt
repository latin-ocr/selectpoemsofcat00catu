NOTES. IV.‚ 1-15. ’13

IV.

1. Catullus points out to some guests his old yacht. Made
at Cytorus or Amastris (the first the name of the hill, the
second of the town) in Paphlagonia (at this time part of the
province of Bithynia), it had received him on board at its
‘birthplace‘ (or, according to Munro, at some port on the
Propontis), and had carried him, by Rhodes and the Cyclades,
along the Adriatic coast, and by the rivers Po and Mincio,
into the lake Benacus (now Lago di Garda), on the island or
peninsula of which, Sirmio (see XXXI.), the oet had a country
seat. Here the vessel now lay, beached or ocked‚ in honour—
able superannuation.

It seems probable that in many of Catullus’ poenis, however
they present to us the freshness of originalsty, he freely imi-
tated a Greek model. See on ιι, mu„ an„ Lxm„ Lm„
LXVI. The Grecisms in this poem are the gender of phaselus
(generally feminine in Latin), the construction ait fuisse
celerrimusl (an enlargement in the Greek spirit of existing
Latin idiom, not peculiar to Catullus; see Hor. Ep. 1. vii. 22,
ait esse paratus, and cf. Verg. 11. 377, δῖα), together with the
attraction of the gender of the adjective (cf. Hor. Sat. Ι. ix.
4, dulcissime rerum, δια), the construction iste post phaselus
(cf. XXXI. l note), the case-ending and lengthening of Propon-
tida, the lengthng of the final syllable of impotentia, the
vocative form Amastri, and the sudden change to direct
address, together with the position of Tibi. The metre is
Pure Iambic z see Appendix I. B.

P. 3. 3. impetum. ¹ No timber floated whose dash she failed to
head, whether called to wing her way with light blade or with
canvas.' The oars were the ship’s wings (πτέρα νηός, Homer)
as well as the sails.

6. Adriatici. The Journey is traced backwards, {rom the

⁴ Italian coast to the Euxine.

8. nobilem, ‘renowned in story)
Thraclam, adjective agreeing with Propontida.

10. ’ἶῖἶὴθτθ that, the yacht of after-time, was earlier a
leafy wood ; for many a day, on Cytorus' ridge‚ she sent forth
whispers from her prattling leafage.’

15. ultima, ‘from the remotest spring of her life,' or ‘from
the primal germ of her race.'

1 It is to be remarked that the MSS. read celerrimum, which would be
parallel to xxx1. 5, xxxvx. 7. xm. 4.

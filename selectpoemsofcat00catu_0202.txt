forgruthfully unfolding the secrets of my breast! Rossbach
rea s,

‘ Condita quin nerei pectoris evoluam'

making teyam . . . . quin: ‘hide . . . . soasnot to.' In
this he is generally followed: but there seems no call for
correction of the text.

Λυχνοκαΐα. Α weaker rendering is ‘on holidays!

91. Sanguinis. Bentley suggested unquinis.

GATULLUS’ POSITION IN LATIN
LITERATURE.

‘ Lepidum novum libellum.'‘

Earum Roman poeti-y, as we have seen, failed for
the most part for lack of form. It was also confined
in subject, and attempted only the epOS, the drama,
satire, and (in a limited sense) the epigram. In the
age of Catullus, better directed study resulted in a
truer and larger sense of the various forms of literary
composition 3 and the lyric, the idyll, and the elegy
were added to Roman literature. This new birth of
Latin poetry is represented to us by Catullus alone.
The works of all the other writers of his time have
been lost 3 and the same irony of fate, which gave us
Hesiod in place of Archilochus and the Greek lyrists,
has preserved Cicero’s translation of Aratus, instead
of the works of Bibaculus and Calvus. Catullus was,
however, as far as we can learn, sar greater than the
rest of his contemporaries 3 and should be regarded,
therefore, as the first in time, as well as in genius, of
Roman lyric‚ elegiae, idyllic, and epigrammatic poets‘

NOTES. LXVIII 13.‚ 86-109. 159

86. compar, ‘mate’ improbius, ‘more unconscionably.'
57. decerpere, ‘ snatch kisses with nippin g bill)

Π 88ξ. ληιιιΙιίνοΙεη ‘than the most passionate-lxearted woman.¹
ursa ΕΎ.

89. tu, Laodamia. furores, ‘fevered love.’

aut nihil aut paulo = literally ‘if not in nothing, then in
little.' Cf. xxn. 4 note.

96. furta, ‘frailties‚’ v. 100. verecundae, ‘decorous’
97. stultorum, ‘ the slaves of jealousy.’
P. 57. 99. in culpa, ‘'on account of her lord's infidelity.'

contudit iram (Hertzberg), ‘ smothcred her burning wrath.'
Cf. Hor. Od. Iv. iii. 8: ‘tumidas contuderit minas) The MSS.

read quotidiana, or cotidiana, emended by Lachmann to con-
coquit iram.

100. omnivoli furta, ‘ the frailtics of Jove in his all-grasping
desire.’ Furta is Haupt's reading for MSS. facta. Cf. ΧΗ. 7.

101. qula nec, ‘But——since it is wrong even to compare
men with gods—drop the thankless task of the palsied sire.’

Between 101 and 102 a loss of verses has been supposed,
the estimates of which vary from 2 to 18 vv. The connection
of thought is not quite simple, but seems to be this ε Catullus
has been urging himself to forgive his mistress’ errors, by
quoting to himself the precedent of J uno. If the queen of
heaven can forgive her husband, sure a poet can forgive his
mistress. Then he checks this comparisou as profane, and,
taking a lower key, calls on himself not to play the part of the
‘ comicus stultus senevst constantly suspicions and unhappy.

103. tamen, ‘besides Cf. Munro on Lucr. v. 1177.
deducta, z‘.e.‚ like a bride.

107. unus, Lachmann with a few' MSS. It seems more
appropriate than vnis, which is against the spirit of 95 et seq.

108. dies is rather out of place. Cf. Lxlv. 9, LXVI. 18Δ
lapide candidiore, ‘ with a brighter stone.⁷ cn. 6 note.

109. quod potui, ‘itis all Ι can give.' Cf. Verg. Ecl. 111. 70.

APPENDIX l. 175

one quconic followed by one pherecratean verse. The syn-
aplzeia is observed, i.e.‚ there is no metrical pause between
the end of the first and the beginning of the second verse, and
so, should a glyconio end with a vowel, the vowel must be
elided, if the pherecratean open with a vowel. This system,
in which XVII. (26 vv.) is composc‹l‚ is generally printed as
one long line—but see on (ii.) and (iii.) below. The scheme is

Glyconic. Pleu ree-rate an.

In this poem, however, the base (or first two syllables, or
first foot) of the glyconio is a spondee in 9 cases ; that of the
pherecratean, also, is twice a spondee.

(ii.) In XXXIV. (24 vv.) three glyconics precede the phere-
cratean, and the synapheia is observed throughout the system.
The base of the glyconio is 8 times spondaic, thrice iambie 3
that of the pherecratean is once iambic.

(iii.) The epithalamium (LXI.) is composed in a system of
four glyconics and a pherecratean, in which of course the
synapheia is observed. The apparent exceptions to the law of
the synapheia, in which a vowel or short syllable precedes
‘ Io Hymen Hymenaee io’ are removed by the pronunciation
of the first io as ‘yo‚’ which is more than probably correct.
In v. 223 omnibus ends the verse, and the next begins with a
vowel: but Catullus may have followed ancient usage in
making the final syllable long, or (more probably) such an
emendation as the interchange of insciis ancl omnibus, or the
substitution of obviis for omnibus is required, in this, the only
exoeptional case in 235 vv. It is to be remarked also that the
name ‘ Aurunculeio. ' is divided between two glyconies. The
base of the glyconio is 13 or 14 times a spondee, that of the

pherecratcan is twice so. One pherecratean (v. 25) replaces
the usual dactyl by a spondee.

D. Catullus has written two Sapphic poems (XL, L1.=
40 vv.), and follows the original metre3 so differing from
Horace who elaborated for himself an almost rigid system,
capable of few variations.l Comparing LI. with the original
poem of Sappho, we find that Sappho twice begins a verse
with trochaic syzygy (— ν - v), Catullus once (13) ; three
times ends averse with a trochee, Catullus twice 3 twice breaks up

which concludes the system, Catullus never ; nine times she
has caesura after a later syllable than the fifth, Catullus twice;
thrice ends a verse with a monosyllable, and Catullus thrice.
Iu XI. he begins a verse with a trochaic syzygy twice, once ends
a verse with a trochee, three times divides a word between two
verses, and eight times has the late caesura. Hence we may
fairly conclude that the scheme of both Sappho and Catullus
admitted two forms,

’’’’’’

of which (a) alone is Horatian3 that both preferred (or at
least freely admitted) the late caesura, which is much rarer
in Horace 3 that the monosyllabic ending, so much avoided
by Horace, was not unwelcome to them ; and that synapheia,
and the consequent division of a word between two verses
(of which only three examples are found in Horace), was
normal with them. Like the hexameter, therefore, in the
hands of Virgil, the Sapphic under Horace's treatment seems
to have been Romanised—that is to say, to have become less
clastic and more regular; but the lyric metre suffered much
more and gained much less than the epic metre in its admis-
sion to the ‘ Latinitas.³

E. The Cnommmo metre (Sapphic sixteen-syllable, or
menter Asclepiad), employed by Sappho and Alcaeus, and,
after Catullus, once or twice by Horace—who, as usual, more
rigidly, requires the end of the two first choriambi to coincide
with the end of a word— is only represented by xxx. The

GENERAL INTRODUOTION. ΧΗ”]’

as it characterizes the ‘Attis' The verse is of the
lightest texture known to Latin poetry. The in-
vocation of the deity, the welcome to the bride, the
assurance of a happy future and the adieu, are full
of delicate imagination‚ simply and gracefully ex-
pressed. The whole is unique in Latin if not in all
literature.

We are sometimes inclined to assume that certain
capacities and feelings, generally such as may be
considered laudable, are peculiar to our own age or
even to our own country. Thus the interpretative
sympathy with inanimate nature has been thought
to be a modern faculty, and the sentiment of home
an English virtue, exclusively. Both of these insulari-
ties of opinion are reproved by Catullus 3 for both the
qualities were elements of the old Italian spirit which
he breathed. Tongues in trees and the passions of
the flowers were as intelligible to him as to us,
although they played a properly subordinate part,
and were not allowed perpetually to intrude them-
selves, in his poetry. A few passages will be sufficient·
to show that he could understand the language of
” nature. He proved his possession os the power of
interpretation when he wrote of

‘ the woods of Cytorus, where the leaves talk in whispers‚'

or showed how, in the agony of destruction,

‘ the oak flings her arms alost, and drops of sweat stand on
the bark οἰ the pine.’

The bride, in the Epithalamium, is as fair and dear
